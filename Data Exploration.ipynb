       "      <td>Jannik Sinner is not known as one of the most expressive characters on the tennis scene.\\nEven so, the Italian world number one's more subdued demeanour was glaringly obvious during his march to the US Open title.\\nReserved celebrations and increased mindfulness were the result of Sinner being embroiled in a doping controversy that shook the tennis world to the core.\\nIn the week leading up to the final Grand Slam tournament of the season in New York, it was revealed Sinner had twice failed anti-doping tests earlier this year.\\nSinner, 23, was found to have low levels of clostebol - a banned anabolic steroid - but was found to have no fault or negligence by an independent tribunal.\\n\"Obviously it was very difficult for me to enjoy in certain moments,\" Sinner said after beating Taylor Fritz to win the US Open on Sunday.\\n\"Also how I behaved or how I walked on the court in certain tournaments before, it was not the same as I used to be, so whoever knows me better, they know that something was wrong.\"\\nOver the course of the past two weeks, he has attempted to put the topic in the background. The rocky start has been transformed into a triumphant finish.\\nYet the case has thrown up lots of debate and a host of questions have not gone away.\\nThe World-Anti Doping Agency (Wada), which draws up the list of banned substances, told BBC Sport it is \"continuing to review\" whether it will appeal against the ruling that Sinner bore no fault.\\nEven if Wada does not appeal, Sinner's second Grand Slam victory will - for many people - continue to have a heavy cloud hanging over it.\\nReputational damage is not easy to shake off.\\nBritish doubles player Tara Moore, also found to have no fault or negligence in a doping case, described the \"trickling away\" of her reputation in the 19 months she was not allowed to play while fighting to clear her name.\\nSimilarly, British athlete Paula Radcliffe and Australian swimmer Ian Thorpe - superstar names in their fields - felt they had been \"tarnished\" by wrongly being accused of doping in huge stories of their time.\\nAlthough Sinner was cleared of wrongdoing, he will never be free of the suspicion and scepticism which remain in some quarters.\\n\"As with any player who tests positive, there is going to be a cloud and some doubt over them for the rest of their career,\" said investigative journalist Edmund Willison, whose Honest Sport website, external specialises in sports doping stories.\\n\"Certainly it will always be in the rear window.\"\\nThe way in which Sinner's case was handled has led to accusations that the world number one received special treatment.\\nQuestions were raised about the speed of the resolution, why Sinner avoided a provisional ban and how the case was kept under wraps.\\nWhen the news broke, there was a backlash from several of Sinner's peers on the ATP Tour who felt he had been treated differently.\\nA provisional ban was applied after each failed test. But Sinner, who claimed £2.75m for winning the US Open and has money-spinning sponsorship deals with Nike and Gucci, had the benefit of being able to afford specialist legal representation.\\nHe escaped suspension because he successfully appealed against the decision by providing what the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) deemed a \"credible explanation\".\\nAustralian former Wimbledon finalist Nick Kyrgios - himself a polarising figure - has continued to be a leading critic, while Britain's Liam Broady said he found himself \"wondering about a lot of the things\" in Sinner's story.\\nAt a meeting of the ATP Tour's player advisory council in New York, locker room representatives used the opportunity to \"discuss the role of the ITIA\" in the case.\\nThere have also been calls for greater \"consistency\" from both Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer in the way every case - regardless of a player's ranking or wealth - is dealt with. \\nSuggestions that Sinner was treated differently to others is strongly refuted by the ITIA.\\n\"All anti-doping cases are different, but the process is always consistent, and this case was dealt with according to the facts, not the player's ranking,\" an ITIA spokesperson told BBC Sport.\\nThe ITIA was satisfied with the explanation which was given quickly by Sinner and his team, and the agency's scientific experts were also happy it was plausible.\\n\"There is independent expert analysis throughout any anti-doping process and the decision is taken by an independent tribunal [from outside the sport],\" added the ITIA.\\n\"We are comfortable that this was dealt with according to the rules.\"\\nAs the world's leading men's player and one of the faces on which tennis pins its hopes of driving interest in its post-superstar world, Sinner becoming the centre of a doping controversy was not a good look.\\nThe 23-year-old twice tested positive in March for clostebol - a steroid that can be used to build muscle mass and enhance athletic performance.\\nAn investigation by the ITIA found Sinner had been inadvertently contaminated with the anabolic steroid by physiotherapist Giacomo Naldi.\\nClostebol is an active ingredient in dermatological cream or spray called Trofodermin, which is used to treat skin abrasions, cuts and wounds and is readily available over the counter in Italy.\\nSinner and his team successfully argued Naldi had been applying Trofodermin - given to him by Sinner's fitness trainer Umberto Ferrara, who is a qualified pharmacist - to a cut on his own hand, then carried out treatments on the player.\\n\"In my mind I know I haven't done anything wrong,\" Sinner said in his pre-US Open news conference.\\nAccording to Italian law, the packaging on Trofodermin must have a visible symbol indicating the presence of a substance included in the Wada list of prohibited substances.\\nDespite the warnings, several Italian athletes - across tennis, football and athletics - have still tested positive for clostebol in recent years.\\nSinner, who praised the professionalism of Naldi and Ferrera before announcing he was no longer \"confident\" working with them because of their \"mistakes\", was the fifth Italian tennis player to have clostebol found in his system.\\nWhile clostebol alone is not believed to have a huge effect on a player, Willison fears in general that it could be an indicator of a deeper, more sophisticated programme.\\n\"Italy has quite clearly been in the midst of a clostebol crisis, of some form or another, for much of the past decade. A decade in which clostebol detection methods have become more sensitive,\" Willison, who wrote an in-depth piece on the subject,, external told BBC Sport.\\n\"Every case has to be treated individually, of course. \\n\"But in the reasoned decision in Sinner's case it does not explicitly refer to the four other clostebol cases in Italian tennis, and I believe that provides important context.\"\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>Captain Harry Kane will become just the 10th man to make 100 England appearances when the Three Lions face Finland in the Nations League at Wembley on Tuesday.\\nThe 31-year-old made his debut in 2015 and is his country's all-time top scorer with 66 goals in 99 games.\\nBBC Sport takes a look at some of his numbers on his journey towards the landmark.\\nBayern Munich striker Kane will become the first person since Wayne Rooney in November 2014 to earn a 100th cap for England.\\nRooney went on to earn 120 caps, putting him second on the all-time appearance list behind former goalkeeper Peter Shilton (125).\\nThe others to have surpassed the century of appearances are David Beckham (115), Steven Gerrard (114), Bobby Moore (108), Ashley Cole (107), Bobby Charlton (106), Frank Lampard (106) and Billy Wright (105).\\n\"When you look at the list [of players with 100 caps] it is a list of some our greatest players,\" Kane said.\\n\"I'm sure when I'm retired I'll look back on this with immense pride.\"\\nKane said he will next target reaching 100 goals after making his 100th England appearance.\\n\"I've done around 15, 16, 17 caps a year whereas a normal year would be 10,\" he added.\\n\"The goals were similar. I felt I was on 30 goals and then I went to 50 and then 60.\\n\"It is definitely there and definitely possible. I feel like I am in a good place and these are good targets to try to reach.\\n\"Some people may see them as unrealistic but I would rather go for something unrealistic and not quite make it rather than be comfortable just saying I will be happy with 70 or 80 goals.\"\\nIt all started for Kane with a goal just 79 seconds into his debut. \\nStarting on the bench in a Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania in March 2015, a 21-year-old Kane came on with the Three Lions 3-0 up and headed in his first goal for his country.\\nSince then he has scored 46 more goals than any other England player. He has also provided more assists than any other player in that time with 17.\\nOf his 99 caps, 29 have come at major tournaments for England (11 at the World Cup, 18 at the Euros), more than any other player.\\nAs well as being England's record scorer, he also has the most goals for England at major tournaments, with 15.\\nKane has scored five hat-tricks for England - against Panama, Bulgaria, Montenegro, Albania and San Marino. Only Jimmy Greaves has scored more with six.\\nHis 99 caps have come under four different managers. He made his debut with Roy Hodgson as boss and played 16 times for him, scoring five goals. \\nKane played in Sam Allardyce’s only game in 2016 before making 81 appearances and scoring 61 goals under Gareth Southgate. \\nHe then started on Saturday in Lee Carsley’s first game in charge against the Republic of Ireland.\\nAsked about what has been the most difficult thing to be able to keep playing at the highest level, Kane told BBC Radio 5 live: \"I think to be able to keep producing great numbers, keep producing great moments is probably the hardest thing to do, because there are many players who are trying to take your spot and to take your place.\\n\"It is healthy to have that but to be able to get my 100th cap in nine years, essentially shows great consistency.\"\\nLast week, Portugal great Cristiano Ronaldo reached the landmark of 900 career goals for club and country at the age of 39.\\nKane is eight years younger than Ronaldo and the Bayern Munich striker says he sees the former Manchester United and Real Madrid forward as inspiration for how long his own career can go.\\n\"I feel in really good shape, both physically and mentally, at a peak in my career,\" he said.\\n\"Watching other players, Ronaldo scoring his 901st goal [against Scotland on Sunday], seeing him compete at 39 years old inspires me to play for as long as possible.\\n\"I love this game, I love representing England more than anything and I don't want it to end any time soon. For me, personally, now it's about continuing to improve and being consistent both in an England shirt and at club level.\\n\"I'm hungry for more. I'm determined to keep pushing the boundaries.\"\\nFormer Premier League striker Chris Sutton believes Kane can continue playing for England for many more years.\\n\"I can see him going very long for a number of reasons,\" Sutton said on BBC Radio 5 live's Monday Night Club. \\n\"Look at England at the moment, who will take his place?\\n\"He doesn't have great pace but he is a ruthless goal scorer and a brilliant footballer. He creates and scores. He is so good at both. He can go on for years and years.\\n\"With his intelligence and the way he plays I think he will be around for a long time yet.\"\\nOn Tuesday, Finland will become the 45th different country Kane has faced with England.\\nHe has scored or assisted against all but 10 of the 44 countries he has played against, scoring the most against Germany with four goals in four appearances.\\nKane has played against Italy the most, facing them six times and scoring three goals against them.\\nShould he score against Finland then he will become just the third player to score on his 100th England appearance, after Wayne Rooney (versus Slovenia in 2014) and Bobby Charlton (against Northern Ireland in 1970).\\n\"We take advantage of him a little but with how good he is,\" Conor Coady, who has played alongside Kane for England, said on the Monday Night Club.\\n\"He is always out there for England. He is the first player to report for England, the first on training pitch\\n\"Being able to train with him, see the quality he brings. I can see him going for plenty of years.\\n\"I don't think he will retire - or will want to [retire] - until England win something. He is such an important player for our country.\"\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>Europe will face a \"hostile\" home crowd \"absolutely desperate\" for the United States to win back the Solheim Cup in Virginia this week, says former captain Mickey Walker.\\nLast year's 14-14 draw in Spain, the first in the contest's 34-year history, meant Europe retained the trophy after victories in 2019 in Scotland and 2021 in Ohio.\\nNo side has held the trophy for a fourth successive time and Europe have won just twice in nine previous events in the US.\\n\"The Americans will feel it is essential to win and it's going to be difficult for Europe because it can get quite hostile,\" Walker, who led Europe to their first triumph in 1992, told BBC Sport.\\n\"The American crowds will be out there to win it. It will be very pro-American and that will be really tough. \\n\"Those that have played before will know what to expect and they will be as prepared as they can be, but it's a lonely place when you're out there playing and 90% of the support is American.\"\\nWalker, who was Europe's captain in the first four editions of the biennial contest, is wary that continued unsporting partisan behaviour will spoil both the Solheim and Ryder Cup.\\nAnd while the Solheim Cup does not appear to have as large an issue, Walker said she felt \"intimidated\" as a spectator as far back as at the 2009 contest in Chicago and \"does not like\" the way it is going.\\nIt is no secret that the Ryder Cup at Whistling Straits in 2021 saw the European players and their families receive some horrendous abuse from a minority of US fans at the course on the banks of Lake Michigan. \\nNo away side has won the Ryder Cup since Europe's victory at Medinah in 2012 and while Padraig Harrington accepted that some of that is down to home captains being able to dictate course set-up, he also acknowledged the part fans play.\\nSpeaking before last year's contest in Italy, the Irishman, who led Europe in 2021, forecast there would be trouble, telling the Daily Telegraph: \"I wish I could say it is one-way traffic, but it isn't and we should realise that and look at our own backyard as well.\\n\"It's not just the players either. The same as in America, the wives and families are being singled out by hecklers as well, with some pretty awful stuff going on.\"\\nWalker agreed, saying: \"The past two Ryder Cups have been bordering on the crowds not behaving very well because they have been so much behind their team.\\n\"Rome was the worst it has been in Europe.\\n\"I don't like it, you want to win just by playing the better golf.\"\\nIt is a sentiment echoed by John Solheim, the son of Karsten and Louise Solheim who have sponsored the tournament since the inaugural event in 1990 and who the trophy is named after.\\n\"It's extremely important to the Americans to win it back, but it doesn't really matter to me who wins,\" he told BBC Sport.\\n\"I just want a close match.\"\\n</td>\n",

But it's possible.\\nDo you think the bad starts for Norris and the ability to keep his tyres fresh are linked? – Anon\\nNo, and actually there is a misunderstanding in the question.\\nFirstly, yes, Norris has had issues at starts and first laps, but most of them are different in nature. So, he lost position to Verstappen at the start in both Spain and the Netherlands, but they were not caused by the same issue.\\nAnd the first-lap mistake he made in Belgium - where he ran wide through a momentary lapse of judgement - was not the same as what happened at Monza - where he lost a place to Piastri because he did not want to risk braking any later for the second chicane in case he took both McLarens out as his team-mate went for the pass.\\nBeyond that, it's not accurate to say Norris is struggling with tyre management. What you saw in Monza - and in Hungary - was simply a consequence of the merits of running in clear air.\\nPeople can forget that these Pirelli tyres are still incredibly sensitive to overheating, despite many years of Pirelli saying they would try to address the issue.\\nAny loss of downforce - such as when following another car - makes the car slide, which overheats the tyres, which affects performance.\\nThis is why in Hungary Piastri looked faster than Norris when the Australian was in the lead, and Norris looked faster than Piastri when the positions were reversed. Simply, it's much easier to keep the tyres in the right window when you are not behind another car.\\nThis phenomenon was also seen with Charles Leclerc on his way to victory in Monza.\\nHow will the wind-tunnel time limits affect the teams' development of their 2026 cars? Could it be an advantage not winning the constructors' title? – Philip\\nF1 operates a sliding scale of permitted aerodynamic development. So, the most successful team in the previous six months has the least permitted wind-tunnel and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) research time for the next six months, and the least successful the most.\\nSo, yes, this will affect the teams as they prepare for the 2026 rules. Whoever wins the constructors' title this year will be able to spend less time researching the rules aerodynamically in the first half of next year than the others.\\nBut the percentage difference is not that great from one place to another, so it should not affect McLaren v Red Bull v Ferrari too much.\\nWe hear a lot about upgrades. What are they and can you give us more details about them? – Nigel\\nAn upgrade is a new part, or series of parts, that is aimed at improving the performance of the car.\\nSo, for example, a new front wing, or a new floor, or a new piece of bodywork. If they are aimed at improving performance, that is classed as an upgrade.\\nThe issue teams are encountering this season is that these upgrades are not always increasing performance.\\nFor example, after Red Bull introduced their first upgrade of the season in Imola, two races later in Canada Mercedes technical director James Allison said he believed it had actually been a downgrade.\\nRed Bull vociferously denied that at the time, but the longer the season has gone on, and the more Red Bull have struggled, the more it is clear that Allison was right.\\nThe problem teams are encountering is that the flow structures created by these current F1 cars, and the way the aerodynamics work, are so complicated that the simulation tools available to the teams are simply not accurate enough to accurately predict how the car will perform on track.\\nOften, teams are finding that the CFD says one thing, the wind tunnel another, and the car behaves differently again when it gets out on track.\\nThis is why McLaren have taken so long to introduce a major upgrade since the big one in Miami that turned them into frontrunners overnight. They have wanted to be absolutely confident it will work, so they can avoid getting lost, as Red Bull have.\\nAnd it's exactly the issue Red Bull have found with their car at the moment.\\nThe problem is, when a team has put on a load of new parts over a period of time, and then find the car is not behaving the way they want, it is fiendishly difficult to unpick what is causing the problem - especially as there is no way of simulating it.\\nWhen was the last time there were seven different winners in a single season? –  Helen\\nThe last time there were seven different winners in a season was 2012.\\nBut that was a very different season to this one; in fact it was almost the reverse.\\nIn 2012, there were seven different winners in the first seven races and Fernando Alonso, then driving for Ferrari, built a substantial championship lead by virtue of being the most consistent. In fact, in the fourth-fastest car, it was probably Alonso’s best season - one of the best by any driver ever, for that matter.\\nBut then Red Bull hit their stride in the final third of the season, and Sebastian Vettel went on a winning run, including four in a row at one point.\\nAdd in some bad luck for Alonso - who was taken out by Romain Grosjean's Lotus at the start in Belgium, and by the Frenchman's team-mate Kimi Raikkonen in Japan - and Vettel overtook him.\\nIt still went to the wire, and Vettel nearly threw it away by getting embroiled in an incident on the first lap in Brazil that damaged his car, but he fought back and clung on.\\nThis time, Verstappen got off to a flyer by dominating the start of the season, only for his team to have apparently lost their way, while McLaren look to be taking on a similar role to Red Bull in 2012.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>Dealing with the fallout from an England loss is not for the faint-hearted.\\nEver since Brendon McCullum took over more than two years ago, every Test reverse has been portrayed as a mortal blow to the Bazball ideology, ammunition to the section of England followers waiting for the whole project to fall on its backside.\\nTo be clear, England are a much better team than they were when McCullum assumed control (admittedly, they could have put Mr Blobby in charge and done better than one win in 17), but they are not the finished article. It is possible to simultaneously be a supporter of their methods and also disappointed, frustrated, even angry when they let themselves down.\\nThe eight-wicket hammering at the hands of Sri Lanka is not England’s most painful in the McCullum era – I’m looking at you, Lord’s Ashes Test of 2023 – though it is comfortably their worst performance.\\nGiven the opposition, strong positions England got themselves into, and the chance of a rare 100% home summer, to be beaten in less than three full days of cricket is borderline unforgivable.\\nAccusations of complacency and arrogance are strong, especially without explicit knowledge of what is going on behind closed doors, but it is tough to argue England haven’t at least been extremely careless.\\nContext is key. The evolution England have gone through has been both necessary and successful. A single defeat in six is hardly a crisis and one wonders what sort of introspection Australia went through when they suffered a similarly poor loss at the hands of West Indies at the Gabba earlier this year. Not too much.\\nThere was a temptation to give England a pass. With the series won, so what if they lost the final Test of a low-pressure summer?\\nThen Joe Root said this: “Coldplay can’t be number one every week.”\\nApart from being an insight into Root’s taste in music – he was always unlikely to be a System of a Down man – it also reveals much about England’s psyche.\\nWhy shouldn’t they, in these conditions and against this Sri Lanka team, win every week?\\nEngland have been transformed since McCullum arrived. Having the ability to play with freedom, confidence and conviction, safe in the knowledge you can brush off a failure, can be an immense strength.\\nOn the other hand, ruthlessness – stand-in captain Ollie Pope referred to a lack of it after the Oval defeat – feels like a key ingredient England must find. They have been open about their planning for the next Ashes, so they can look to the build-up of Michael Vaughan’s team when they beat the great Australia side of 2005. A year earlier, Vaughan’s England went 7-0 across the home summer.\\nTo see where England can learn for the future, we can look to their recent past.\\nOnly the second defeat they suffered under McCullum came early last year in Wellington, where they needlessly enforced the follow-on against New Zealand and eventually were beaten in an all-time great Test match by one run.\\nThere was an intoxication over England’s entertainment that masked the wasteful nature of the loss. It bled into the home Ashes, not helped by a week playing golf before the first Test. By the time England came to their senses, they were 2-0 down and reliant on the Manchester weather in their quest to regain the urn. We know the rest.\\nThe England side that lost to Sri Lanka is almost entirely different from the Wonder of Wellington. Only three players survive, albeit with injured captain Ben Stokes and opener Zak Crawley to return.\\nIt will be fascinating to see how England respond. For new faces like Shoaib Bashir, Gus Atkinson and Jamie Smith, a trio that have had successful first home summers as Test cricketers, this defeat should really sting. A lesson from Mother Cricket might be the best thing that could have happened to England.\\nWe won’t have long to find out. The first Test in Pakistan begins in less than a month. England are planning to name a squad by the end of the week, once confusion over the venues is sorted.\\nIt largely picks itself. Dan Lawrence has probably played himself out of the squad, especially with Jordan Cox able to act as back-up batter and keeper. Jack Leach should return as second spinner. The pace-bowling ranks are depleted, so it might be a case of those still standing getting a place on the plane. There will be a decision to make on Chris Woakes, attack-leader at home, but with a poor record abroad.\\nEngland are judged by their success in the biggest series against India and Australia, neither of whom they have beaten since 2018. They play both sides back-to-back across 2025 and into 2026. Until then, we won’t really know how good England are.\\nBeforehand they have seven Tests against Pakistan, New Zealand and Zimbabwe to find the ruthlessness that separates the very good teams from the great ones.\\nTo return to Root’s Coldplay reference, Chris Martin - a big cricket fan - belts out these lines on Viva La Vida: “One minute, I held the key, next the walls were closed on me, and I discovered that my castles stand, upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand.”\\nEngland hold the key to their own success, but this loss shows the foundations can be shaky. They have less than a year to make them rock-solid for the Bazball reckoning.\\n</td>\n",

When Tammy puts in a performance like that a little bit of pressure is taken off. \\n\"We earned the right to be able to have the back end we did.\"\\nIreland captain Gaby Lewis: \"Cricket is a sport of ups and downs, and today was definitely a down day.\\n\"We are a very young squad, we're learning on the go. We've got three bowlers under the age of 19, it's very hard on them.\"\\nPlayer of the match Tammy Beaumont: \"I found it tough early on and Ireland were bowling tight lines with a slower pace on the pitch. \\n\"Every time I felt like we were going well, we'd lose a wicket. I had to keep bringing it back. Freya Kemp really showed her class.\"\\n</td>\n",

I love this group, I really do,” said Bellamy.\\n“These are the toughest conditions I’ve been in. Nothing about coming here has been easy. You could have had a lot of excuses about this trip. The change of venue, the travel here, a bus driver who took his time, the conditions, but sometimes you learn from it.\\n“There is a reason why this group have qualified for major tournaments. It wasn’t a football match. The conditions weren’t going to allow it. I couldn’t even wear trainers here. My summer bomber jacket is gone!\\n“We saw after five minutes the pitch tore up and then it becomes about who can win the battle. It was close at times. If it was a boxing match, there were two teams out on their feet and we came out on top. Sometimes you take more pride from these wins.”\\nBellamy has already revitalised Welsh football just two games into his tenure. Players have been glowing in their praise for the new head coach, while fans were singing his name throughout Monday’s game in Niksic.\\nWhile the draw with Turkey demonstrated how exhilarating Bellamy’s team could be in a footballing sense – tactically and stylistically – the win over Montenegro was an illustration of this squad’s mental fortitude and determination to secure victory in testing conditions.\\nThe match was meant to have been played at the Podgorica National Stadium but, as the pitch there was deemed unplayable, the fixture was switched to Niksic, 53km away, just two weeks before kick-off.\\nHeavy rain fell constantly on Monday, causing the pitch to cut up badly and hamper both teams in what turned into a chaotic encounter.\\nBut despite a nervy end to the game, Wales were able to repel Montenegro’s attempts to snatch a late equaliser and hold on for a valuable three points.\\n“This camp has been incredible. Last night I was really excited about the game but also sad as it ends tomorrow,” said Bellamy.\\n“Even with the squad of people, they’re all going to leave me and I don’t want them to go. It’s been such an incredible 10 days.\\n“I really couldn’t be more proud of them. I love them. They’re such a great group and I’ve learned a lot off them as well. Tonight was all heart.”\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>With over 30 million padel players worldwide, the sport is booming and has never been more popular.\\nDavid Beckham, Serena Williams and even French President Emmanuel Macron count themselves as fans of the racquet sport.\\nThe growth is even more remarkable considering it was only invented in 1969 by a husband and wife duo on holiday as a way to avoid boredom.\\nHunter Charlton, from the Sporting Witness podcast, spoke to one of the pair, Viviana Corcuera, about the birth, growth and evolution of padel.\\nIn 1969, while enjoying their new holiday home in the fashionable Las Brisas suburb of Mexican seaport city Acapulco, model Viviana and husband Enrique created a game that was to become a global sensation.\\nTo pass the time, the wealthy couple began throwing a ball at a wall and Viviana quickly fell in love with the rudimentary version of the game.\\nShe issued an ultimatum to her husband: \"If you don't make a court in Acapulco, I'm going back home to Argentina. No padel court, no Viviana.\"\\nEnrique agreed and in the backdrop of the crashing waves of the Pacific Ocean, a group of builders began the construction.\\nA court measuring 20 metres long by 10 metres wide was built out of cement, making it easy to maintain.\\nEnrique insisted on a crucial design element linked to an unpleasant memory he had of attending boarding school in England. Enrique said: \"The school had a ball court, the balls fell outside of the court.\\n\"I suffered so much from the cold and from going to look for balls all the time that I want a closed court.\"\\nHe asked the bricklayer and the engineer to close the sides completely with wire fences.\\nPadel is a racquet sport that uses the same scoring conventions as lawn tennis but is played on courts around a third smaller.\\nThe game is mainly played in the doubles format, with players using solid racquets with no strings. The courts are enclosed and, like in squash, players can bounce the ball off the walls.\\nPadel balls are smaller than those used in tennis and players serve underarm.\\n\"It's a game of knowing how to place the ball gently. The beauty of the game was that players needed little time to start rallying, but mastering it required the right combination of technique, strategy, athleticism and dedication,\" Viviana explains.\\nIn the 1960s and '70s, Acapulco was a major holiday destination for Hollywood's glitterati and that is where padel's popularity with celebrities began.\\nAmerican diplomat Henry Kissinger frequently picked up a racquet, as did many of the other high-profile visitors.\\nThe game crossed the Atlantic in 1974 when Prince Alfonso of Spain built two padel courts in Marbella. He had developed a passion for the game after holidaying with the Corcueras.\\nThe following year, padel arrived in Argentina, where it exploded in popularity. But there was one problem: there was no rule book.\\nEnrique used this to his advantage.\\n\"Enrique wasn't getting any younger, so he changed the rules to win matches. He was the inventor, so we couldn't complain,\" Viviana says.\\nThroughout the 1980s and '90s, the sport continued to grow at pace. The introduction of transparent walls meant that spectators, commentators and cameras could view the whole courts.\\nThe world's first international tournament - the Corcuera Cup - took place in Mexico in 1991, followed by the first World Championship in Spain the next year.\\nPlayers now include a number of Premier League footballers, with new courts in Manchester visited by Manchester United stars who have been known to record their visits on social media.\\nThe Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) describes padel as \"the fastest-growing sport in the world\", and as \"an innovative form of tennis\".\\nAt the end of 2023, the LTA said there were 350 courts available in Great Britain, with the number rapidly rising, while Sport England said over 50,000 people played padel at least once in England in the year to November 2023.\\nFormer Paris St-Germain and Newcastle forward Hatem Ben Arfa has taken his padel passion one step further than the Manchester United enthusiasts.\\nHe reportedly ranked 997th in France earlier this year and is said to have competed in 70 tournaments during 2023.\\nViviana believes padel took off so quickly because it can be enjoyed by the entire family - from grandparents to young children.\\n\"It brings the family together. We can all play. The grandfather can play with the grandson, the father with the son,\" she said.\\n\"I'm very proud to have been part of the invention of this game with my husband making the first set of rules going from a wire fence to glass. My husband died many years ago in 1999; what I would have given for him to be able to see how far the sport has come.\"\\n</td>\n",

Sabalenka went on to struggle with a stomach problem in her French Open quarter-final defeat in June, before withdrawing from Wimbledon a few weeks later with a shoulder injury.\\nThe injury-enforced break allowed her to refresh and, in New York, she has shown a fun and relaxed approach with her team off the court.\\nWhen she successfully defended her Australian Open title in January, she made it a tradition to write her signature on her fitness trainer Jason Stacy's head.\\nInstead of her signature, Stacy stuck Sabalenka's iconic tiger tattoo on the top of his head for the final against Pegula.\\nThe second seed was seen poking fun at Stacy's head in her celebrations, while she joked during her post-match news conference that he should have placed the image in the middle of his forehead.\\n\"She is living her best life,\" former British number one Laura Robson told Sky Sports.\\n\"You just have to look at the environment she has around her.

We have shown what a good team we can be.\"\\nEngland have still won five of their six Tests this summer, beating West Indies 3-0 and Sri Lanka 2-1.\\nStill, their performance at The Oval was incredibly wasteful and allowed the impressive Sri Lankans to earn their first win in 11 Tests against England.\\nIn the first innings, England collapsed from 261-3 to 325 all out, then were hustled out for a dismal 156 in 34 overs in the second innings.\\nThat left Sri Lanka a victory target of 219, which they were taken to on the fourth morning by Pathum Nissanka's outstanding 127 not out. It is only Sri Lanka's fourth win in a Test in this country.\\n\"I don't think we played our best cricket this week and that is going to happen from time to time,\" added Root. \"Coldplay can't be number one every week.\"\\nEngland's performance led to an accusation of complacency from former captain Sir Alastair Cook, while another ex-skipper, Michael Vaughan, warned them not to \"take the mickey out of Test cricket\".\\nBut Ollie Pope, who deputised for the injured Ben Stokes as England captain for the Sri Lanka series, rejected suggestions his team were lacking \"hunger\".\\n\"I wouldn't say it's a lack of an edge or not really having that desire to go and put together a massive score,\" said Pope.\\n\"It can just happen in cricket, and it's been a good gap since we last did that.\"\\nPope, leading England for the first time, said he loved \"every bit\" of the job, but is ready to hand the reins back to Stokes when he returns to fitness.\\nStokes injured his hamstring playing for Northern Superchargers in The Hundred last month.

They used many existing venues and then put a Paralympic overlay on top but that meant that there were lots of steps, platform lifts, not always decent viewing platforms and a frequent sense of frustration that while disabled people were competing, it wasn’t always so easy for disabled people to come along and watch.\\nPublic transport has been another issue, as it always will be in an old city like Paris.\\nBuses have been overhauled to make them accessible, which is a start, but the Metro system is not and the head of the Paris transport network said before the Games that it remained a weak spot for disabled travellers so it will be interesting to see what happens after the Games.\\nI didn’t try the transport, partly because I didn’t need to, and being in the fortunate position of being media-accredited gives you access to venues that spectators don’t get.\\nWe were driven around the city in the dedicated Games lanes, and went from the underground car parks to the venues with little difficulty but I know the day-to-day experience outside Games time will be significantly different.\\nHaving visited Paris a number of times before, the biggest change I have noticed is the attitude towards disabled people. People are generally more helpful and for getting around there are more things like dropped curbs, although the cobblestones, of which there are lots, are a challenge for a wheelchair user.\\nThe medal table is binary. The medal target set by UK Sport was 100-140 and that was achieved with two days of competition still to go, but there will be lots of debate in the coming weeks about what does success look like and each sport will be under review for the next cycle.\\nThe number of golds, silvers and bronzes and near misses will be analysed.  ParalympicsGB is also proud of the breadth of the performances but there will be some things outside its control for Los Angeles 2028, such as what other countries are doing and how they are being funded.\\nThe British swimmers were phenomenal and their multi-medallists like Poppy Maskill, Alice Tai and William Ellard have been superb, as were the cyclists with Sarah Storey again winning medals, as she was doing when we were on the GB team together.\\nHowever, the athletics team has probably not performed how they would like with six golds and 18 medals overall, their lowest total since Beijing in 2008, and it shows how quickly the world can move on in some disciplines.\\nFrance, once a powerhouse of athletics, only won five medals in track and field and no golds. Had they won, it would have made a difference to the atmosphere in the Stade de France although it was still electric whenever a home athlete competed.\\nParalympicsGB is not in a position to challenge China for top spot, but were pretty secure in second place in the face of some strong competition from the United States.\\nBut with these Games barely over, every sport will now be looking at where is the next set of ‘talent’ going to come from – whether it is from talent transfers from other sports, improving the existing talent pool or finding new athletes.\\nWhile everyone was excited about Paris, the next Games in LA 2028 were at the back of many minds.\\nBroadcasters NBC were out here in force and it will be interesting to see how the coverage of the Games has gone down in the USA.\\nUnfortunately they didn’t have Snoop Dogg here like they did for the Olympics. Maybe they needed to pay him more to come here – it would have been really cool to have him here!\\nIn terms of competition, I think the US Paralympic Committee could learn from what GB have achieved here and in Tokyo and work on having a wider spread of medals across sports, because they have huge potential.\\nThey also need to get their athletes known and for Americans to care about them.\\nWe now have a Paralympic champion in Hunter Woodhall married to an Olympic champion in Tara Davis-Woodhall and they could do things to really put Para-sport on the map.\\nOverall, the Games have been incredible and perhaps the sports legacy for France will come in 2028, but it does feel like we are leaving a city that will have embraced the Games and perhaps will think a little differently about disability, and a Paralympic movement which has taken another step forward.\\n</td>\n",

I didn't cuss. Didn't do none of that. I'm still trying to figure it out,\" the 30-year-old Super Bowl champion said.\\n\"I was just doing what my uncle always told me to do if I was in a situation like that - just listen, put your hands on the steering wheel. Gotta be careful, man.\\n\"They said I was speeding, but I don't know. They said I was speeding, reckless driving, whatever.\"\\nWhen informed by a reporter that one of the police officers had been placed on leave, he added: \"That should tell you everything you need to know.\"\\nHill said he wanted to use his platform to make sure there was a \"positive\" outcome from the incident for himself and the police.\\nHe added: \"I do want to use this platform to say 'What if I wasn't Tyreek Hill?' \\n\"Everybody has bad apples in every situation, but I want to be able to use this platform to figure out a way to flip this and make it a positive on both ends, my end and Miami-Dade and that way we can team together and do something positive for the community.\"\\nIn a statement, Miami-Dade Police Department director Stephanie V Daniels said: \"I initiated an internal affairs investigation to ensure a thorough review of the matter.\\n\"One of the officers involved in the incident has been placed on administrative duties while the investigation is conducted.\\n\"I'm committed to transparency and accountability to the community with any situation involving my officers.\"\\nEarlier, Hill's agent Drew Rosenhaus told ESPN, external it had been a \"heartbreaking situation\" but Hill was OK.\\nRosenhaus said: \"How things escalated into the situation they were in - handcuffs and being held on the ground by police - is mind-boggling to me. \\n\"I'm deeply concerned by that, very troubled. We will be looking into it.\"\\nHe added: \"This is crazy, I've never seen anything like it.\"\\nOn Monday, a police union for Miami-Dade officers issued a statement saying Hill was \"uncooperative\" and \"initiated\" the incident which led to him being handcuffed.\\n\"First, to be clear, at no time was he ever under arrest. He was briefly detained for officer safety, after driving in a manner in which he was putting himself and others in great risk of danger,\" read the statement from South Florida Police Benevolent Association president Steadman Stahl.\\n\"Upon being stopped, Mr Hill was not immediately cooperative with the officers on the scene who, pursuant to policy and for their immediate safety, placed Mr Hill in handcuffs.\\n\"Mr Hill, still uncooperative, refused to sit on the ground and was therefore redirected to the ground.\"\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>The 2024 Paralympics in Paris have come to an end after 11 days of thrilling sporting action.\\nFor Great Britain, it was a Games to remember. ParalympicsGB won 49 gold medals as part of a total medal haul of 124.\\nIn and out of the sporting action, there were many moments that will live long in the memory, both for those in action and those spectating.\\nHere are a selection of those moments from the past week and a half in Paris.\\nIn wheelchair tennis, GB’s Alfie Hewett earned a gold and silver medal double in the final days of the Paralympics.\\nHewett, 26, won his men’s doubles final with Gordon Reid on Friday - having lost three Paralympic finals across the previous two Games in Rio de Janeiro and Tokyo. Upon victory, he waved his racquet in the air and embraced Reid following a win he described as the \"stuff of dreams\".\\nHe was back in singles action on Saturday and having suffered a groin injury in the opening game, and then lost the first set 6-2, came back to take Japan’s Tokito Oda to three sets.\\nHewett, who only needed a men’s singles gold to complete a career set of accomplishments, won the second set 6-4, and then had a match point in the decider - but Oda came from 5-3 down to win it 7-5.\\nWhile Hewett would have hoped for two golds, his back-to-back medals and doubles gold are reward for a player who has now featured in five Paralympic finals.\\nThe first of two Sundays at the Paralympics produced 18 medals for ParalympicsGB, including 12 golds.\\nNot only was it their most successful day of the Games, but the most successful this century.\\nThere was an even split across sports, with Para-rowing, Para-cycling, Para-athletics and Para-swimming all producing multiple medals, including a first of the Games for Hannah Cockroft in the women’s T34 100m final.\\nIt was not just individuals who stood out, with GB’s golden Sunday including mixed double sculls, mixed coxed four, mixed team sprint and mixed freestyle triumphs.\\nGreat Britain started day four with 11 golds and 26 medals, ending it with 23 golds and 44 medals.\\nMore than a third of ParalympicsGB’s gold medals - 18 out of 49 - came in the pool.\\nGreat Britain’s young squad of swimmers included the duo of Poppy Maskill, 19, and Alice Tai, 25, who won five medals each.\\nFor debutant Maskill in particular, it was a Games to remember. She entered five events and won three golds and two silvers across S14 individual events, as well as the mixed team freestyle relay.\\nThere were two S12 golds for Stephen Clegg in 100m events - the backstroke and butterfly finals - adding to the three medals he won in Tokyo three years ago.\\nWilliam Ellard, 18, won two golds and a silver, while Maisie Summers-Newton, 22, and Tully Kearney, 27, also provided Great Britain with a pair of gold medals each.\\nBritain won swimming medals on all 10 full days of the Paralympics, all but one of which included at least one gold.\\nThe opening day of the Games in Paris bought heartbreak from Kadeena Cox, one of ParalympicsGB's star names heading into this summer.\\nIn the women’s C1-5 500m time trial, where Cox was among the favourites, she struggled to get rhythm on the bike and fell off within seconds of her start, unable to finish the race.\\nCox was helped off the track in tears following the crash, which she described as a “nightmare”.\\nKeen to make up for her singles disappointment in the team event three days later, she helped GB win gold on Super Sunday alongside Jody Cundy and Jaco van Gass in the mixed C1-5 750m team sprint final.\\nCox's gold was her seventh career Paralympic medal.\\nParalympicsGB's squad consisted of a wide range of experienced competitors, as well as a look at the next generation, who delivered plenty of medals.\\nSarah Storey extended her run as Great Britain's most-decorated Paralympian. At 46, she won golds in the women’s C4-5 road race and C5 time trial, taking her to 19 Paralympic golds and 30 medals in total.\\nHannah Cockroft, 32, competing at her fourth career Games, continued her perfect record of T34 gold medals, winning over 100 and 800 metres. All nine of her medals have been gold.\\nWhile Storey and Cockroft were among the familiar faces to win medals, there was also a look to the future.\\nOn the same day, there were silver medals for the teenage duo of Iona Winnifrith and Bly Twomey. Winnifrith finished second in the women’s SB7 100m breaststroke final, while Twomey took Para-table tennis bronzes in the women's singles and doubles events, the latter alongside Felicity Pickard.\\nWinnifrith, aged 13, and Twomey, 14, were among those to show that ParalympicsGB has a bright future.\\nJodie Grinham won gold and bronze medal in Para-shooting while seven months pregnant.\\nShe was first Paralympian known to have been pregnant while competing at a Games.\\n\"As long as I'm healthy and baby's healthy, I knew we could compete,” Grinham said.\\nTracy Otto of the United States had a summer in Paris to remember.\\nMidway through the Games, she announced that not only she had got engaged to partner Ricky Riessl under the Eiffel Tower, but that she, like Grinham, was also expecting her first child.\\nThe 28-year-old confirmed the news on Instagram, captioning the photo \"may not have won a medal today but I am going home with something shiny\".\\n</td>\n",

       "0       Jannik Sinner is not known as one of the most expressive characters on the tennis scene.\\nEven so, the Italian world number one's more subdued demeanour was glaringly obvious during his march to the US Open title.\\nReserved celebrations and increased mindfulness were the result of Sinner being embroiled in a doping controversy that shook the tennis world to the core.\\nIn the week leading up to the final Grand Slam tournament of the season in New York, it was revealed Sinner had twice failed anti-doping tests earlier this year.\\nSinner, 23, was found to have low levels of clostebol - a banned anabolic steroid - but was found to have no fault or negligence by an independent tribunal.\\n\"Obviously it was very difficult for me to enjoy in certain moments,\" Sinner said after beating Taylor Fritz to win the US Open on Sunday.\\n\"Also how I behaved or how I walked on the court in certain tournaments before, it was not the same as I used to be, so whoever knows me better, they know that something was wrong.\"\\nOver the course of the past two weeks, he has attempted to put the topic in the background. The rocky start has been transformed into a triumphant finish.\\nYet the case has thrown up lots of debate and a host of questions have not gone away.\\nThe World-Anti Doping Agency (Wada), which draws up the list of banned substances, told BBC Sport it is \"continuing to review\" whether it will appeal against the ruling that Sinner bore no fault.\\nEven if Wada does not appeal, Sinner's second Grand Slam victory will - for many people - continue to have a heavy cloud hanging over it.\\nReputational damage is not easy to shake off.\\nBritish doubles player Tara Moore, also found to have no fault or negligence in a doping case, described the \"trickling away\" of her reputation in the 19 months she was not allowed to play while fighting to clear her name.\\nSimilarly, British athlete Paula Radcliffe and Australian swimmer Ian Thorpe - superstar names in their fields - felt they had been \"tarnished\" by wrongly being accused of doping in huge stories of their time.\\nAlthough Sinner was cleared of wrongdoing, he will never be free of the suspicion and scepticism which remain in some quarters.\\n\"As with any player who tests positive, there is going to be a cloud and some doubt over them for the rest of their career,\" said investigative journalist Edmund Willison, whose Honest Sport website, external specialises in sports doping stories.\\n\"Certainly it will always be in the rear window.\"\\nThe way in which Sinner's case was handled has led to accusations that the world number one received special treatment.\\nQuestions were raised about the speed of the resolution, why Sinner avoided a provisional ban and how the case was kept under wraps.\\nWhen the news broke, there was a backlash from several of Sinner's peers on the ATP Tour who felt he had been treated differently.\\nA provisional ban was applied after each failed test. But Sinner, who claimed £2.75m for winning the US Open and has money-spinning sponsorship deals with Nike and Gucci, had the benefit of being able to afford specialist legal representation.\\nHe escaped suspension because he successfully appealed against the decision by providing what the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) deemed a \"credible explanation\".\\nAustralian former Wimbledon finalist Nick Kyrgios - himself a polarising figure - has continued to be a leading critic, while Britain's Liam Broady said he found himself \"wondering about a lot of the things\" in Sinner's story.\\nAt a meeting of the ATP Tour's player advisory council in New York, locker room representatives used the opportunity to \"discuss the role of the ITIA\" in the case.\\nThere have also been calls for greater \"consistency\" from both Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer in the way every case - regardless of a player's ranking or wealth - is dealt with. \\nSuggestions that Sinner was treated differently to others is strongly refuted by the ITIA.\\n\"All anti-doping cases are different, but the process is always consistent, and this case was dealt with according to the facts, not the player's ranking,\" an ITIA spokesperson told BBC Sport.\\nThe ITIA was satisfied with the explanation which was given quickly by Sinner and his team, and the agency's scientific experts were also happy it was plausible.\\n\"There is independent expert analysis throughout any anti-doping process and the decision is taken by an independent tribunal [from outside the sport],\" added the ITIA.\\n\"We are comfortable that this was dealt with according to the rules.\"\\nAs the world's leading men's player and one of the faces on which tennis pins its hopes of driving interest in its post-superstar world, Sinner becoming the centre of a doping controversy was not a good look.\\nThe 23-year-old twice tested positive in March for clostebol - a steroid that can be used to build muscle mass and enhance athletic performance.\\nAn investigation by the ITIA found Sinner had been inadvertently contaminated with the anabolic steroid by physiotherapist Giacomo Naldi.\\nClostebol is an active ingredient in dermatological cream or spray called Trofodermin, which is used to treat skin abrasions, cuts and wounds and is readily available over the counter in Italy.\\nSinner and his team successfully argued Naldi had been applying Trofodermin - given to him by Sinner's fitness trainer Umberto Ferrara, who is a qualified pharmacist - to a cut on his own hand, then carried out treatments on the player.\\n\"In my mind I know I haven't done anything wrong,\" Sinner said in his pre-US Open news conference.\\nAccording to Italian law, the packaging on Trofodermin must have a visible symbol indicating the presence of a substance included in the Wada list of prohibited substances.\\nDespite the warnings, several Italian athletes - across tennis, football and athletics - have still tested positive for clostebol in recent years.\\nSinner, who praised the professionalism of Naldi and Ferrera before announcing he was no longer \"confident\" working with them because of their \"mistakes\", was the fifth Italian tennis player to have clostebol found in his system.\\nWhile clostebol alone is not believed to have a huge effect on a player, Willison fears in general that it could be an indicator of a deeper, more sophisticated programme.\\n\"Italy has quite clearly been in the midst of a clostebol crisis, of some form or another, for much of the past decade. A decade in which clostebol detection methods have become more sensitive,\" Willison, who wrote an in-depth piece on the subject,, external told BBC Sport.\\n\"Every case has to be treated individually, of course. \\n\"But in the reasoned decision in Sinner's case it does not explicitly refer to the four other clostebol cases in Italian tennis, and I believe that provides important context.\"\\n  \n",

I felt I was on 30 goals and then I went to 50 and then 60.\\n\"It is definitely there and definitely possible. I feel like I am in a good place and these are good targets to try to reach.\\n\"Some people may see them as unrealistic but I would rather go for something unrealistic and not quite make it rather than be comfortable just saying I will be happy with 70 or 80 goals.\"\\nIt all started for Kane with a goal just 79 seconds into his debut. \\nStarting on the bench in a Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania in March 2015, a 21-year-old Kane came on with the Three Lions 3-0 up and headed in his first goal for his country.\\nSince then he has scored 46 more goals than any other England player. He has also provided more assists than any other player in that time with 17.\\nOf his 99 caps, 29 have come at major tournaments for England (11 at the World Cup, 18 at the Euros), more than any other player.\\nAs well as being England's record scorer, he also has the most goals for England at major tournaments, with 15.\\nKane has scored five hat-tricks for England - against Panama, Bulgaria, Montenegro, Albania and San Marino. Only Jimmy Greaves has scored more with six.\\nHis 99 caps have come under four different managers. He made his debut with Roy Hodgson as boss and played 16 times for him, scoring five goals. \\nKane played in Sam Allardyce’s only game in 2016 before making 81 appearances and scoring 61 goals under Gareth Southgate. \\nHe then started on Saturday in Lee Carsley’s first game in charge against the Republic of Ireland.\\nAsked about what has been the most difficult thing to be able to keep playing at the highest level, Kane told BBC Radio 5 live: \"I think to be able to keep producing great numbers, keep producing great moments is probably the hardest thing to do, because there are many players who are trying to take your spot and to take your place.\\n\"It is healthy to have that but to be able to get my 100th cap in nine years, essentially shows great consistency.\"\\nLast week, Portugal great Cristiano Ronaldo reached the landmark of 900 career goals for club and country at the age of 39.\\nKane is eight years younger than Ronaldo and the Bayern Munich striker says he sees the former Manchester United and Real Madrid forward as inspiration for how long his own career can go.\\n\"I feel in really good shape, both physically and mentally, at a peak in my career,\" he said.\\n\"Watching other players, Ronaldo scoring his 901st goal [against Scotland on Sunday], seeing him compete at 39 years old inspires me to play for as long as possible.\\n\"I love this game, I love representing England more than anything and I don't want it to end any time soon. For me, personally, now it's about continuing to improve and being consistent both in an England shirt and at club level.\\n\"I'm hungry for more. I'm determined to keep pushing the boundaries.\"\\nFormer Premier League striker Chris Sutton believes Kane can continue playing for England for many more years.\\n\"I can see him going very long for a number of reasons,\" Sutton said on BBC Radio 5 live's Monday Night Club. \\n\"Look at England at the moment, who will take his place?\\n\"He doesn't have great pace but he is a ruthless goal scorer and a brilliant footballer. He creates and scores. He is so good at both. He can go on for years and years.\\n\"With his intelligence and the way he plays I think he will be around for a long time yet.\"\\nOn Tuesday, Finland will become the 45th different country Kane has faced with England.\\nHe has scored or assisted against all but 10 of the 44 countries he has played against, scoring the most against Germany with four goals in four appearances.\\nKane has played against Italy the most, facing them six times and scoring three goals against them.\\nShould he score against Finland then he will become just the third player to score on his 100th England appearance, after Wayne Rooney (versus Slovenia in 2014) and Bobby Charlton (against Northern Ireland in 1970).\\n\"We take advantage of him a little but with how good he is,\" Conor Coady, who has played alongside Kane for England, said on the Monday Night Club.\\n\"He is always out there for England. He is the first player to report for England, the first on training pitch\\n\"Being able to train with him, see the quality he brings. I can see him going for plenty of years.\\n\"I don't think he will retire - or will want to [retire] - until England win something. He is such an important player for our country.\"\\n  \n",

It will be very pro-American and that will be really tough. \\n\"Those that have played before will know what to expect and they will be as prepared as they can be, but it's a lonely place when you're out there playing and 90% of the support is American.\"\\nWalker, who was Europe's captain in the first four editions of the biennial contest, is wary that continued unsporting partisan behaviour will spoil both the Solheim and Ryder Cup.\\nAnd while the Solheim Cup does not appear to have as large an issue, Walker said she felt \"intimidated\" as a spectator as far back as at the 2009 contest in Chicago and \"does not like\" the way it is going.\\nIt is no secret that the Ryder Cup at Whistling Straits in 2021 saw the European players and their families receive some horrendous abuse from a minority of US fans at the course on the banks of Lake Michigan. \\nNo away side has won the Ryder Cup since Europe's victory at Medinah in 2012 and while Padraig Harrington accepted that some of that is down to home captains being able to dictate course set-up, he also acknowledged the part fans play.\\nSpeaking before last year's contest in Italy, the Irishman, who led Europe in 2021, forecast there would be trouble, telling the Daily Telegraph: \"I wish I could say it is one-way traffic, but it isn't and we should realise that and look at our own backyard as well.\\n\"It's not just the players either. The same as in America, the wives and families are being singled out by hecklers as well, with some pretty awful stuff going on.\"\\nWalker agreed, saying: \"The past two Ryder Cups have been bordering on the crowds not behaving very well because they have been so much behind their team.\\n\"Rome was the worst it has been in Europe.\\n\"I don't like it, you want to win just by playing the better golf.\"\\nIt is a sentiment echoed by John Solheim, the son of Karsten and Louise Solheim who have sponsored the tournament since the inaugural event in 1990 and who the trophy is named after.\\n\"It's extremely important to the Americans to win it back, but it doesn't really matter to me who wins,\" he told BBC Sport.\\n\"I just want a close match.\"\\n  \n",

So many people helped me get to this spot.\\n\"I'm really thankful for my surgeon, my loved ones, my friends, the staff and the training staff to help me get back. Obviously I wanted to take a shot and feel the physicality of it.\\n\"Once I threw a couple of balls and took a shot, it felt good.\"\\nThe home team had to secure the win without running back Christian McCaffrey, who was ruled out shortly before kick-off.\\nThe 28-year-old did not play because of a calf and Achilles injury.\\nThat left an opportunity for Jordan Mason, who started a game for the first time in what is his third NFL season.\\nHe finished with an impressive 28 carries for 147 yards and a touchdown.\\nMason was not the only 49er to shine, with Jake Moody also adding a franchise-record-tying six field goals.\\n49ers wide receiver Ricky Pearsall was also in attendance at the game, just 10 days after he was shot in San Francisco.\\nPearsall was pictured with the first responders who helped him.\\nThe 24-year-old was taken to hospital and released the following day.\\nA 17-year-old is in custody after being charged with attempted murder and robbery.\\n  \n",
       "4   F1 continues with round 17 taking place at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix at Baku City Circuit from 13-15 September.\\nLast time out, Charles Leclerc secured a stunning home win for Ferrari, ahead of the McLarens of Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris.\\nBBC F1 correspondent Andrew Benson answers your questions before the race in Baku.\\nNow that Max Verstappen is bleeding points (several grands prix already, actually) do you think the title will go down to the wire? – Ioannis\\nThere is definitely a much bigger chance of the drivers' championship going to the wire than there was three or four races ago.\\nAnd the fact McLaren themselves now recognise that explains why they are actively admitting they will discuss whether to ask Oscar Piastri to back Lando Norris for the remaining eight races, where feasible.\\nUntil Monza, McLaren lacked confidence that a) their car would be sufficiently competitive at a sufficient number of tracks; and b) that Red Bull, given their strength in recent seasons, would struggle enough.\\nBut the consistency of Red Bull's problems, the length of time since Max Verstappen won a race and McLaren's performance at Monza have changed their mindset.\\nIt is still a tall order - Norris needs to claw back on average nearly eight points a race to beat Verstappen by the end of the year. But it's possible.\\nDo you think the bad starts for Norris and the ability to keep his tyres fresh are linked? – Anon\\nNo, and actually there is a misunderstanding in the question.\\nFirstly, yes, Norris has had issues at starts and first laps, but most of them are different in nature. So, he lost position to Verstappen at the start in both Spain and the Netherlands, but they were not caused by the same issue.\\nAnd the first-lap mistake he made in Belgium - where he ran wide through a momentary lapse of judgement - was not the same as what happened at Monza - where he lost a place to Piastri because he did not want to risk braking any later for the second chicane in case he took both McLarens out as his team-mate went for the pass.\\nBeyond that, it's not accurate to say Norris is struggling with tyre management. What you saw in Monza - and in Hungary - was simply a consequence of the merits of running in clear air.\\nPeople can forget that these Pirelli tyres are still incredibly sensitive to overheating, despite many years of Pirelli saying they would try to address the issue.\\nAny loss of downforce - such as when following another car - makes the car slide, which overheats the tyres, which affects performance.\\nThis is why in Hungary Piastri looked faster than Norris when the Australian was in the lead, and Norris looked faster than Piastri when the positions were reversed. Simply, it's much easier to keep the tyres in the right window when you are not behind another car.\\nThis phenomenon was also seen with Charles Leclerc on his way to victory in Monza.\\nHow will the wind-tunnel time limits affect the teams' development of their 2026 cars? Could it be an advantage not winning the constructors' title? – Philip\\nF1 operates a sliding scale of permitted aerodynamic development. So, the most successful team in the previous six months has the least permitted wind-tunnel and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) research time for the next six months, and the least successful the most.\\nSo, yes, this will affect the teams as they prepare for the 2026 rules. Whoever wins the constructors' title this year will be able to spend less time researching the rules aerodynamically in the first half of next year than the others.\\nBut the percentage difference is not that great from one place to another, so it should not affect McLaren v Red Bull v Ferrari too much.\\nWe hear a lot about upgrades. What are they and can you give us more details about them? – Nigel\\nAn upgrade is a new part, or series of parts, that is aimed at improving the performance of the car.\\nSo, for example, a new front wing, or a new floor, or a new piece of bodywork. If they are aimed at improving performance, that is classed as an upgrade.\\nThe issue teams are encountering this season is that these upgrades are not always increasing performance.\\nFor example, after Red Bull introduced their first upgrade of the season in Imola, two races later in Canada Mercedes technical director James Allison said he believed it had actually been a downgrade.\\nRed Bull vociferously denied that at the time, but the longer the season has gone on, and the more Red Bull have struggled, the more it is clear that Allison was right.\\nThe problem teams are encountering is that the flow structures created by these current F1 cars, and the way the aerodynamics work, are so complicated that the simulation tools available to the teams are simply not accurate enough to accurately predict how the car will perform on track.\\nOften, teams are finding that the CFD says one thing, the wind tunnel another, and the car behaves differently again when it gets out on track.\\nThis is why McLaren have taken so long to introduce a major upgrade since the big one in Miami that turned them into frontrunners overnight. They have wanted to be absolutely confident it will work, so they can avoid getting lost, as Red Bull have.\\nAnd it's exactly the issue Red Bull have found with their car at the moment.\\nThe problem is, when a team has put on a load of new parts over a period of time, and then find the car is not behaving the way they want, it is fiendishly difficult to unpick what is causing the problem - especially as there is no way of simulating it.\\nWhen was the last time there were seven different winners in a single season? –  Helen\\nThe last time there were seven different winners in a season was 2012.\\nBut that was a very different season to this one; in fact it was almost the reverse.\\nIn 2012, there were seven different winners in the first seven races and Fernando Alonso, then driving for Ferrari, built a substantial championship lead by virtue of being the most consistent. In fact, in the fourth-fastest car, it was probably Alonso’s best season - one of the best by any driver ever, for that matter.\\nBut then Red Bull hit their stride in the final third of the season, and Sebastian Vettel went on a winning run, including four in a row at one point.\\nAdd in some bad luck for Alonso - who was taken out by Romain Grosjean's Lotus at the start in Belgium, and by the Frenchman's team-mate Kimi Raikkonen in Japan - and Vettel overtook him.\\nIt still went to the wire, and Vettel nearly threw it away by getting embroiled in an incident on the first lap in Brazil that damaged his car, but he fought back and clung on.\\nThis time, Verstappen got off to a flyer by dominating the start of the season, only for his team to have apparently lost their way, while McLaren look to be taking on a similar role to Red Bull in 2012.\\n  \n",

It is possible to simultaneously be a supporter of their methods and also disappointed, frustrated, even angry when they let themselves down.\\nThe eight-wicket hammering at the hands of Sri Lanka is not England’s most painful in the McCullum era – I’m looking at you, Lord’s Ashes Test of 2023 – though it is comfortably their worst performance.\\nGiven the opposition, strong positions England got themselves into, and the chance of a rare 100% home summer, to be beaten in less than three full days of cricket is borderline unforgivable.\\nAccusations of complacency and arrogance are strong, especially without explicit knowledge of what is going on behind closed doors, but it is tough to argue England haven’t at least been extremely careless.\\nContext is key. The evolution England have gone through has been both necessary and successful. A single defeat in six is hardly a crisis and one wonders what sort of introspection Australia went through when they suffered a similarly poor loss at the hands of West Indies at the Gabba earlier this year. Not too much.\\nThere was a temptation to give England a pass. With the series won, so what if they lost the final Test of a low-pressure summer?\\nThen Joe Root said this: “Coldplay can’t be number one every week.”\\nApart from being an insight into Root’s taste in music – he was always unlikely to be a System of a Down man – it also reveals much about England’s psyche.\\nWhy shouldn’t they, in these conditions and against this Sri Lanka team, win every week?\\nEngland have been transformed since McCullum arrived. Having the ability to play with freedom, confidence and conviction, safe in the knowledge you can brush off a failure, can be an immense strength.\\nOn the other hand, ruthlessness – stand-in captain Ollie Pope referred to a lack of it after the Oval defeat – feels like a key ingredient England must find. They have been open about their planning for the next Ashes, so they can look to the build-up of Michael Vaughan’s team when they beat the great Australia side of 2005. A year earlier, Vaughan’s England went 7-0 across the home summer.\\nTo see where England can learn for the future, we can look to their recent past.\\nOnly the second defeat they suffered under McCullum came early last year in Wellington, where they needlessly enforced the follow-on against New Zealand and eventually were beaten in an all-time great Test match by one run.\\nThere was an intoxication over England’s entertainment that masked the wasteful nature of the loss. It bled into the home Ashes, not helped by a week playing golf before the first Test. By the time England came to their senses, they were 2-0 down and reliant on the Manchester weather in their quest to regain the urn. We know the rest.\\nThe England side that lost to Sri Lanka is almost entirely different from the Wonder of Wellington. Only three players survive, albeit with injured captain Ben Stokes and opener Zak Crawley to return.\\nIt will be fascinating to see how England respond. For new faces like Shoaib Bashir, Gus Atkinson and Jamie Smith, a trio that have had successful first home summers as Test cricketers, this defeat should really sting. A lesson from Mother Cricket might be the best thing that could have happened to England.\\nWe won’t have long to find out. The first Test in Pakistan begins in less than a month. England are planning to name a squad by the end of the week, once confusion over the venues is sorted.\\nIt largely picks itself. Dan Lawrence has probably played himself out of the squad, especially with Jordan Cox able to act as back-up batter and keeper. Jack Leach should return as second spinner. The pace-bowling ranks are depleted, so it might be a case of those still standing getting a place on the plane. There will be a decision to make on Chris Woakes, attack-leader at home, but with a poor record abroad.\\nEngland are judged by their success in the biggest series against India and Australia, neither of whom they have beaten since 2018. They play both sides back-to-back across 2025 and into 2026. Until then, we won’t really know how good England are.\\nBeforehand they have seven Tests against Pakistan, New Zealand and Zimbabwe to find the ruthlessness that separates the very good teams from the great ones.\\nTo return to Root’s Coldplay reference, Chris Martin - a big cricket fan - belts out these lines on Viva La Vida: “One minute, I held the key, next the walls were closed on me, and I discovered that my castles stand, upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand.”\\nEngland hold the key to their own success, but this loss shows the foundations can be shaky. They have less than a year to make them rock-solid for the Bazball reckoning.\\n  \n",

Sargent 2-60\\nIreland 45 all out (16.5 overs): Raymond-Hoey 22 (37); Cross 3-8, Filer 3-10\\nEngland won by 275 runs\\nScorecard\\nTammy Beaumont's sparkling 150 not out helped set up England's 275-run thrashing over Ireland in a one-sided second one-day international in Belfast.\\nThe hosts were bowled out for just 45 - their lowest ever ODI total - in reply to England's imposing 320-8.\\nOpener Beaumont batted throughout for her 10th ODI century - the most by any Englishwoman - with support from Freya Kemp, who bludgeoned 65 from 47 balls.\\nIn reply, Ireland slumped to 8-4 inside the fourth over of their chase in a calamitous start and they failed to recover, handing England their biggest ODI win in terms of runs.\\nCaptain Kate Cross continued her fine form, taking 3-8 after her career-best 6-30 in the first ODI on Saturday, while Lauren Filer's pace proved too much for Ireland as she finished with 3-10.\\nOnly opener Una Raymond-Hoey reached double figures, contributing 22 from 37 balls as the gulf between the two sides was astonishingly stark. \\nOff-spinner Georgia Davis made her international debut, following the five debutants in Saturday's opener, and finished with an impressive 2-19, while Kemp also claimed two. \\nThe victory also sees England secure a series win, with the third ODI taking place at the same venue on Wednesday, which is followed by three T20s in Clontarf, Dublin.\\nBeaumont and Cross are England's most experienced players in the squad to take on Ireland, with a separate group travelling to the United Arab Emirates for the T20 World Cup next month. \\nAnd while Cross starred in the series opener, Beaumont missed out at the top of the order.\\nHere, however, she batted with her trademark swagger and confidence that showed a determination not to miss out again.\\nAt times, she had to dig deep when batting with England's new faces like Hollie Armitage, Paige Scholfield and Mady Villiers, absorbing pressure and guiding them through some spells of tight bowling. \\nBut in the destructive Kemp she found her perfect companion as they added 101 for the fourth wicket.\\nThe all-rounder is one of only two of the squad in Ireland to also be heading to the World Cup (alongside Bess Heath), and found some form at the perfect time with her first ODI fifty coming from just 37 balls. \\nThe knock included seven fours and two sixes, allowing Beaumont to accumulate in the middle overs, before an explosive finish saw her go from her century to 150 in just 22 balls. \\nWhile England's side is generally inexperienced, Beaumont is an established world-class performer and showed that when at her very best, she is a formidable match-winner with only Australian Meg Lanning and New Zealand's Suzie Bates ahead of her in terms of ODI centuries. \\nIt was a poor performance from Ireland, who proved in the first ODI their batting is capable of competing with England after posting 210 - still a below-par total, but at least a respectable one. \\nBut with captain Gaby Lewis bowled by Cross in the first over and star all-rounder Orla Prendergast dismissed lbw in Cross' second, they had lost their two most experienced players with just seven runs on the board and neither of them had troubled the scorers. \\nThe difficult had become almost impossible, with Amy Hunter, a talented batter but only 18 years old, also falling in the first over and from there, England were simply too good for their opponents. \\nCross reaped her rewards with accuracy while Filer rushed the batters for pace, having Leah Paul caught behind, inducing a miscued pull shot from Rebecca Stokell and splattering Arlene Kelly's stumps with a yorker. \\nKemp and Davis mopped up the rest as Ireland only scored three boundaries in their innings, two for Raymond-Hoey and one for Freya Sargent. \\nFast bowler Issy Wong, making her first England outing of the summer, was not even required to bowl. \\nIt was a humbling day for Ireland, who are a young side but having beaten Sri Lanka in an ODI series last month, they would have been hoping to put up much more of a fight against England, which they will look to put right in the final match of the series.\\nEngland captain Kate Cross, speaking to Cricket Ireland: \"I am enjoying it. When Tammy puts in a performance like that a little bit of pressure is taken off. \\n\"We earned the right to be able to have the back end we did.\"\\nIreland captain Gaby Lewis: \"Cricket is a sport of ups and downs, and today was definitely a down day.\\n\"We are a very young squad, we're learning on the go. We've got three bowlers under the age of 19, it's very hard on them.\"\\nPlayer of the match Tammy Beaumont: \"I found it tough early on and Ireland were bowling tight lines with a slower pace on the pitch. \\n\"Every time I felt like we were going well, we'd lose a wicket. I had to keep bringing it back. Freya Kemp really showed her class.\"\\n  \n",

I love this group, I really do,” said Bellamy.\\n“These are the toughest conditions I’ve been in. Nothing about coming here has been easy. You could have had a lot of excuses about this trip. The change of venue, the travel here, a bus driver who took his time, the conditions, but sometimes you learn from it.\\n“There is a reason why this group have qualified for major tournaments. It wasn’t a football match. The conditions weren’t going to allow it. I couldn’t even wear trainers here. My summer bomber jacket is gone!\\n“We saw after five minutes the pitch tore up and then it becomes about who can win the battle. It was close at times. If it was a boxing match, there were two teams out on their feet and we came out on top. Sometimes you take more pride from these wins.”\\nBellamy has already revitalised Welsh football just two games into his tenure. Players have been glowing in their praise for the new head coach, while fans were singing his name throughout Monday’s game in Niksic.\\nWhile the draw with Turkey demonstrated how exhilarating Bellamy’s team could be in a footballing sense – tactically and stylistically – the win over Montenegro was an illustration of this squad’s mental fortitude and determination to secure victory in testing conditions.\\nThe match was meant to have been played at the Podgorica National Stadium but, as the pitch there was deemed unplayable, the fixture was switched to Niksic, 53km away, just two weeks before kick-off.\\nHeavy rain fell constantly on Monday, causing the pitch to cut up badly and hamper both teams in what turned into a chaotic encounter.\\nBut despite a nervy end to the game, Wales were able to repel Montenegro’s attempts to snatch a late equaliser and hold on for a valuable three points.\\n“This camp has been incredible. Last night I was really excited about the game but also sad as it ends tomorrow,” said Bellamy.\\n“Even with the squad of people, they’re all going to leave me and I don’t want them to go. It’s been such an incredible 10 days.\\n“I really couldn’t be more proud of them. I love them. They’re such a great group and I’ve learned a lot off them as well. Tonight was all heart.”\\n  \n",

No padel court, no Viviana.\"\\nEnrique agreed and in the backdrop of the crashing waves of the Pacific Ocean, a group of builders began the construction.\\nA court measuring 20 metres long by 10 metres wide was built out of cement, making it easy to maintain.\\nEnrique insisted on a crucial design element linked to an unpleasant memory he had of attending boarding school in England. Enrique said: \"The school had a ball court, the balls fell outside of the court.\\n\"I suffered so much from the cold and from going to look for balls all the time that I want a closed court.\"\\nHe asked the bricklayer and the engineer to close the sides completely with wire fences.\\nPadel is a racquet sport that uses the same scoring conventions as lawn tennis but is played on courts around a third smaller.\\nThe game is mainly played in the doubles format, with players using solid racquets with no strings. The courts are enclosed and, like in squash, players can bounce the ball off the walls.\\nPadel balls are smaller than those used in tennis and players serve underarm.\\n\"It's a game of knowing how to place the ball gently. The beauty of the game was that players needed little time to start rallying, but mastering it required the right combination of technique, strategy, athleticism and dedication,\" Viviana explains.\\nIn the 1960s and '70s, Acapulco was a major holiday destination for Hollywood's glitterati and that is where padel's popularity with celebrities began.\\nAmerican diplomat Henry Kissinger frequently picked up a racquet, as did many of the other high-profile visitors.\\nThe game crossed the Atlantic in 1974 when Prince Alfonso of Spain built two padel courts in Marbella. He had developed a passion for the game after holidaying with the Corcueras.\\nThe following year, padel arrived in Argentina, where it exploded in popularity. But there was one problem: there was no rule book.\\nEnrique used this to his advantage.\\n\"Enrique wasn't getting any younger, so he changed the rules to win matches. He was the inventor, so we couldn't complain,\" Viviana says.\\nThroughout the 1980s and '90s, the sport continued to grow at pace. The introduction of transparent walls meant that spectators, commentators and cameras could view the whole courts.\\nThe world's first international tournament - the Corcuera Cup - took place in Mexico in 1991, followed by the first World Championship in Spain the next year.\\nPlayers now include a number of Premier League footballers, with new courts in Manchester visited by Manchester United stars who have been known to record their visits on social media.\\nThe Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) describes padel as \"the fastest-growing sport in the world\", and as \"an innovative form of tennis\".\\nAt the end of 2023, the LTA said there were 350 courts available in Great Britain, with the number rapidly rising, while Sport England said over 50,000 people played padel at least once in England in the year to November 2023.\\nFormer Paris St-Germain and Newcastle forward Hatem Ben Arfa has taken his padel passion one step further than the Manchester United enthusiasts.\\nHe reportedly ranked 997th in France earlier this year and is said to have competed in 70 tournaments during 2023.\\nViviana believes padel took off so quickly because it can be enjoyed by the entire family - from grandparents to young children.\\n\"It brings the family together. We can all play. The grandfather can play with the grandson, the father with the son,\" she said.\\n\"I'm very proud to have been part of the invention of this game with my husband making the first set of rules going from a wire fence to glass. My husband died many years ago in 1999; what I would have given for him to be able to see how far the sport has come.\"\\n  \n",

Kevin de Bruyne says Belgium have to \"be better in every way\" after they were beaten comfortably by France in the Nations League on Monday. \\nThe Manchester City midfielder said he had let his team-mates know \"what went wrong\" during a charged exchange at half-time. \\nBelgium are third in League A Group 2, level on three points with France. \\nDe Bruyne conceded the side are not as good as they were in 2018, when they reached the semi-finals of the World Cup, but added: \"Other things are unacceptable. I'm not going to say what.\"\\nBelgium opened their Nations League campaign with a 3-1 win against Israel - with De Bruyne scoring twice. But after starting brightly against France, they fell behind to goals by Kolo Muani and Ousmane Dembele. \\nSpeaking to Belgian broadcaster VTM after the 2-0 defeat, De Bruyne would not elaborate on what was said during his half-time team talk.\\n\"I cannot repeat that in the media but it has to be better in every way,\" said the 33-year-old. \\n\"If the standard we want to reach is the best, but we're no longer good enough to get to that level, then you have to give everything. \\n\"If you don't even do that, it's over.\" \\nDe Bruyne did, however, highlight what he feels is a weakness in Belgium's style of play. \\n\"If you stay with six at the back, there is no connection,\" he added. \"It is what it is. \\n\"It is not about transition, but about people who do not perform their tasks.\"\\nBelgium head coach Domenico Tedesco said he could see why De Bruyne was frustrated with the performance.\\n\"He is our captain and has a huge winning mentality, so he can also react emotionally,\" said Tedesco.  \\n  \n",

2026 after leaving Atletico Madrid as a free agent in July. \\nDepay played 31 times for Atletico last season and scored nine goals. \\nThe 30-year-old featured for the Netherlands at Euro 2024 this summer but he was left out of the squad by head coach Ronald Koeman for September's Nations League matches. \\nHowever, Koeman says Depay's move to Brazil will not close the door on his international future like that of team-mate Steven Bergwijn, who has been criticised by Koeman for his switch to the Saudi Pro League. \\n\"I disapproved of Steven Bergwijn's move to Saudi, with Memphis it can be different,\" Koeman told reporters on Monday.\\n\"The level of the league in Brazil is different, so yes, he can still be part of the national team, but it depends on his fitness and if he reaches his level.\"\\nDepay started his career at PSV Eindhoven in 2011 and later had spells at Manchester United, Lyon and Barcelona before joining Atletico in 2023. \\nHe made his Netherlands debut in 2013 and has scored 46 goals in 98 appearances. \\n  \n",

midfielder Ruben Neves says Cristiano Ronaldo's winner against Scotland was another shot across the bows of those who question the quality of Saudi Arabia's domestic football.\\nThe 27-year-old Neves helped Al-Halil win the title after his move last summer, while veteran forward Ronaldo's Al-Nassr were runners-up.\\nAnd Ronaldo followed up his record-breaking 900th career goal against Croatia on Thursday by coming off the bench to score the decisive late goal against the Scots as Portugal began their Nations League Group A1 campaign with two 2-1 home wins.\\nAsked about the 39-year-old's continued impact despite now playing in the Saudi Pro League, Neves told the Portugal FA website: \"I invite those people to watch Saudi football.\"\\nHe added: \"I have said this a few times - if you compare my GPS data from English football to Saudi football, I run even more, but with the difference that I run in 40 degrees [celsius]. \\n\"I am in good shape physically. Both Cristiano and I proved today that Saudi football has quality.\"\\nNeves suggested it is \"of course\" realistic for Ronaldo to achieve his new target of 1,000 goals as \"with Cristiano, anything is possible\".\\nHead coach Roberto Martinez explained that Ronaldo was on the bench after starting against Croatia because \"Cristiano can't play two 90-minute games\" so close together at his age.\\n\"Cristiano is in a very good moment,\" he said. \"It's September, he's played three games for the club. The important thing is that we need to protect all the players. \\n\"I liked his commitment. He's an incredible player.\"\\nAs against Croatia, Ronaldo was set up by a Nuno Mendes cross, the Paris St-Germain left-back having also come on as a substitute against Scotland.\\nHowever, like his manager, Mendes stressed that it was a collective effort to secure a \"deserved victory\" after \"a very tough game\", having to fight back from an early Scott McTominay goal to win 2-1.\\nManchester United midfielder Bruno Fernandes fired the second-half equaliser but stressed it was \"not a perfect\" 30th birthday as he would \"have preferred it to be less difficult\". \\n\"Cristiano Ronaldo's influence is always the same, regardless of whether he starts the game or starts on the bench,\" he added. \\n  \n",

I remember all the tough losses here,\" Sabalenka said.\\n\"They say you're going to see the reason later. I see the reason right now. \\n\"That's why it's very special, because no matter what, every time I was coming back stronger and I was learning. I never gave up on this dream.\"\\nBefore this year's US Open, Sabalenka said she was trying to find \"things which bring joy\" after a tough year.\\nIn March, her former boyfriend Konstantin Koltsov died in what Sabalenka called \"an unthinkable tragedy\".\\nShe later said, with hindsight, she should have taken a break from playing. Sabalenka went on to struggle with a stomach problem in her French Open quarter-final defeat in June, before withdrawing from Wimbledon a few weeks later with a shoulder injury.\\nThe injury-enforced break allowed her to refresh and, in New York, she has shown a fun and relaxed approach with her team off the court.\\nWhen she successfully defended her Australian Open title in January, she made it a tradition to write her signature on her fitness trainer Jason Stacy's head.\\nInstead of her signature, Stacy stuck Sabalenka's iconic tiger tattoo on the top of his head for the final against Pegula.\\nThe second seed was seen poking fun at Stacy's head in her celebrations, while she joked during her post-match news conference that he should have placed the image in the middle of his forehead.\\n\"She is living her best life,\" former British number one Laura Robson told Sky Sports.\\n\"You just have to look at the environment she has around her. She has her physio tattooing a lion on his head and you see them all laughing and joking.\\n\"It translates into her game on the court because everything is going to plan off the court.\"\\nBehind her cheerful approach, however, is a bigger motivation for Sabalenka to keep pursuing Grand Slam success.\\nShe has spoken about the impact of losing her father, Sergey, who died in 2019, and says it is her goal to \"put our family name in the history of tennis\".\\n\"Every time I see my name on that trophy, I'm so proud of myself, I'm proud of my family that they never gave up on my dream,\" she said.\\n\"They were doing everything they could to keep me going.\"\\nA three-time Grand Slam champion on hard courts, Sabalenka has lost just one of her past 28 major matches on the surface.\\nSabalenka has quickly returned to the top of her game during the summer hard-court swing - winning the title in Cincinnati last month before succeeding at Flushing Meadows.\\nFormer world number one and 18-time major singles winner Martina Navratilova has described her as the \"best hard-court player in the world\".\\nSabalenka can now challenge world number one Iga Swiatek - the 'Queen of Clay' after winning a third straight French Open title in June - for the year-end world number one ranking.\\n\"It's so much more interesting now with the way that Sabalenka is playing because before it felt like Swiatek was just a level above everyone around her,\" former British number one Annabel Croft said on BBC 5 Live.\\n\"It feels like Sabalenka has got that inner confidence and belief.

I was expecting to find retirement hard and be missing tennis a lot and wanting to get back on the tennis court on tour.\\n\"So far it has been the complete opposite to what I was thinking.\"\\nThe 37-year-old won his first Grand Slam in 2012 at the US Open before ending Britain's 77-year wait for a men's Wimbledon champion in 2013 when he defeated Novak Djokovic, before winning it again in 2016.\\nMurray, who won Olympic gold in the singles at London 2012 and Rio 2016, played the final match of his career at Paris 2024, losing in the doubles quarter-finals after epic comeback wins in the previous two rounds.\\nHe acknowledged there was no \"perfect ending\" for a tennis player but revealed he was now feeling guilt-free around his four children and wife Kim.\\n\"The thing that I always found difficult in recent years was that there was always a guilt associated with what I was doing,\" Murray, who played 1,001 singles matches in his career, added.\\n\"If I was going away for a trip of like three to four weeks I would feel guilty leaving my children at home or being away from my wife for a long time with them, so missing the kids I found hard.\\n\"But if I was at home with the kids then I was running around and spending a lot of my time on my feet after training.\\n\"I was then thinking 'is this going to affect my training or performance the next day, should I have my feet up?' I found that stuff difficult over the last few years.\"\\nIt was not just the latter years of his career Murray found difficult, with the media criticism in his glory days also presenting struggles.\\nThe Briton felt even though he was \"extremely successful\" there was something he was \"failing at\" because of the high expectations put upon him.\\n\"It was really hard for me at times, reaching the final at Wimbledon and being criticised for your work or feeling you are not good enough,\" he added.\\n\"Which I think is wrong and I don't know if that would be the case in every country.\\n\"It might have not been the case, but my perception was I was feeling I was being attacked even when I was doing really well, and that was pretty hard.\"\\nMurray wants to stay involved in sport and will continue to \"love tennis\" but is turning his focus to the golf course.\\nDespite not being able to play much in recent years because of back and hip problems, he is still determined to push himself.\\n\"I want to get to scratch, whether that is possible or not I don't know,\" Murray said. \\n\"I've got a lot of time on my hands to practise.\"\\n  \n",

                                The 2021 UK Championship winner Zhao Xintong is set to return to snooker later this month after serving a ban.\\nHe was one of 10 Chinese players to be given bans last year as part of the sport’s biggest match-fixing scandal, although he did not directly throw a match himself.\\nZhao is entered to play in the WPBSA Q Tour event in Bulgaria, which starts on 20 September in Sofia.\\nThe 27-year-old was given a ban of one year and eight months, reduced from two and a half years after his early admissions and guilty plea.\\nHe had to pay £7,500 in costs. He accepted charges of being a party to another player fixing two matches and betting on matches himself.\\nHis suspension ran from when he was first suspended in January 2023, and he was free to play on 2 September this year.\\nZhao received the lowest penalty of the 10 players banned and is drawn to play Vilius Schulte-Ebbert on his return.\\n\\nZhao remains suspended in China only until July 2025 after authorities there imposed a longer suspension, said the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA).\\n“The Chinese Billiards and Snooker Association has now confirmed that their sanction only applies to mainland China and that Zhao Xintong is permitted to play in events outside of China from the end of his WPBSA suspension,\" it said.\\n“Zhao will have served the suspension imposed by the Independent Disciplinary Commission by 1st September 2024, and he has paid his costs order. This means that he is eligible to play in WPBSA-governed events from 2nd September 2024.\"\\nLiang Wenbo and Li Hang were handed lifetime bans for their involvement in the scandal.\\nEight other players received bans ranging from 20 months to five years and four months.\\nThe allegations included manipulating games, approaching players to cheat, betting on snooker and fixing matches.\\nYan Bingtao, the 2021 Masters champion, was banned until December 2027,\\nHe accepted charges of fixing four snooker matches he played in and betting on matches.\\n  \n",

We have shown what a good team we can be.\"\\nEngland have still won five of their six Tests this summer, beating West Indies 3-0 and Sri Lanka 2-1.\\nStill, their performance at The Oval was incredibly wasteful and allowed the impressive Sri Lankans to earn their first win in 11 Tests against England.\\nIn the first innings, England collapsed from 261-3 to 325 all out, then were hustled out for a dismal 156 in 34 overs in the second innings.\\nThat left Sri Lanka a victory target of 219, which they were taken to on the fourth morning by Pathum Nissanka's outstanding 127 not out. It is only Sri Lanka's fourth win in a Test in this country.\\n\"I don't think we played our best cricket this week and that is going to happen from time to time,\" added Root. \"Coldplay can't be number one every week.\"\\nEngland's performance led to an accusation of complacency from former captain Sir Alastair Cook, while another ex-skipper, Michael Vaughan, warned them not to \"take the mickey out of Test cricket\".\\nBut Ollie Pope, who deputised for the injured Ben Stokes as England captain for the Sri Lanka series, rejected suggestions his team were lacking \"hunger\".\\n\"I wouldn't say it's a lack of an edge or not really having that desire to go and put together a massive score,\" said Pope.\\n\"It can just happen in cricket, and it's been a good gap since we last did that.\"\\nPope, leading England for the first time, said he loved \"every bit\" of the job, but is ready to hand the reins back to Stokes when he returns to fitness.\\nStokes injured his hamstring playing for Northern Superchargers in The Hundred last month. He is expected to be fit for England's tour of Pakistan in October.\\nThat series was due to be played in Karachi, Multan and Rawalpindi,but renovation work is likely to render Karachi unavailable.\\nDespite some suggestion that part of the series could take place outside of Pakistan, that is now not thought to be the case, with new venues expected to be confirmed this week.\\nFollowing that, England will name their squad. Zak Crawley is also hopeful he will join Stokes in returning after the opener missed the Sri Lanka series because of a broken finger.\\nEngland also have a slight concern over the fitness of pace bowler Gus Atkinson, who struggled during the third Test because of a thigh problem. \\nAs a result he has been withdrawn from the upcoming one-day series against Australia and replaced by Olly Stone.\\n\"I think he's OK,\" said Pope. \"He's got a couple of weeks off now to refresh. I've chatted to him and he said it feels better today than when he first felt it. Fingers crossed he's all good.\"\\n  \n",

lost to Jannik Sinner in a physically demanding US Open semi-final in New York on Friday.\\n\"After a short turnaround following the US Open, Jack will be joining the team in Manchester on Tuesday ahead of the first match on Wednesday,\" a spokesperson for Draper said.\\n\"Jack and his team are working hard to get fit and Leon [Smith] will take all this into account when he makes his team selection.\"\\nThe British team will take on Finland on Wednesday, before facing Argentina on Friday and then 2022 champions Canada on Sunday, 15 September in Group D.\\nHenry Patten, who won the men's doubles title at Wimbledon with Finland's Harri Heliovaara, replaced Joe Salisbury in the five-man team.\\nCaptain Smith also named Billy Harris, the veteran Dan Evans and experienced doubles player Neal Skupski in his squad.\\nHarris replaced former British number one Cameron Norrie, who had to withdraw from the US Open through injury.\\nThe Davis Cup finals, which feature eight countries, will be held in the Spanish city of Malaga in November.\\n  \n",

Many of the cites that have followed since then have struggled.\\nLondon had to be mindful, not only of the public nature of the costs and the desire to not have white elephants, but of the promises that were made to inspire a generation.\\nParis took that further in terms of sustainability. They used many existing venues and then put a Paralympic overlay on top but that meant that there were lots of steps, platform lifts, not always decent viewing platforms and a frequent sense of frustration that while disabled people were competing, it wasn’t always so easy for disabled people to come along and watch.\\nPublic transport has been another issue, as it always will be in an old city like Paris.\\nBuses have been overhauled to make them accessible, which is a start, but the Metro system is not and the head of the Paris transport network said before the Games that it remained a weak spot for disabled travellers so it will be interesting to see what happens after the Games.\\nI didn’t try the transport, partly because I didn’t need to, and being in the fortunate position of being media-accredited gives you access to venues that spectators don’t get.\\nWe were driven around the city in the dedicated Games lanes, and went from the underground car parks to the venues with little difficulty but I know the day-to-day experience outside Games time will be significantly different.\\nHaving visited Paris a number of times before, the biggest change I have noticed is the attitude towards disabled people. People are generally more helpful and for getting around there are more things like dropped curbs, although the cobblestones, of which there are lots, are a challenge for a wheelchair user.\\nThe medal table is binary. The medal target set by UK Sport was 100-140 and that was achieved with two days of competition still to go, but there will be lots of debate in the coming weeks about what does success look like and each sport will be under review for the next cycle.\\nThe number of golds, silvers and bronzes and near misses will be analysed.  ParalympicsGB is also proud of the breadth of the performances but there will be some things outside its control for Los Angeles 2028, such as what other countries are doing and how they are being funded.\\nThe British swimmers were phenomenal and their multi-medallists like Poppy Maskill, Alice Tai and William Ellard have been superb, as were the cyclists with Sarah Storey again winning medals, as she was doing when we were on the GB team together.\\nHowever, the athletics team has probably not performed how they would like with six golds and 18 medals overall, their lowest total since Beijing in 2008, and it shows how quickly the world can move on in some disciplines.\\nFrance, once a powerhouse of athletics, only won five medals in track and field and no golds. Had they won, it would have made a difference to the atmosphere in the Stade de France although it was still electric whenever a home athlete competed.\\nParalympicsGB is not in a position to challenge China for top spot, but were pretty secure in second place in the face of some strong competition from the United States.\\nBut with these Games barely over, every sport will now be looking at where is the next set of ‘talent’ going to come from – whether it is from talent transfers from other sports, improving the existing talent pool or finding new athletes.\\nWhile everyone was excited about Paris, the next Games in LA 2028 were at the back of many minds.\\nBroadcasters NBC were out here in force and it will be interesting to see how the coverage of the Games has gone down in the USA.\\nUnfortunately they didn’t have Snoop Dogg here like they did for the Olympics. Maybe they needed to pay him more to come here – it would have been really cool to have him here!\\nIn terms of competition, I think the US Paralympic Committee could learn from what GB have achieved here and in Tokyo and work on having a wider spread of medals across sports, because they have huge potential.\\nThey also need to get their athletes known and for Americans to care about them.\\nWe now have a Paralympic champion in Hunter Woodhall married to an Olympic champion in Tara Davis-Woodhall and they could do things to really put Para-sport on the map.\\nOverall, the Games have been incredible and perhaps the sports legacy for France will come in 2028, but it does feel like we are leaving a city that will have embraced the Games and perhaps will think a little differently about disability, and a Paralympic movement which has taken another step forward.\\n  \n",

I didn't cuss. Didn't do none of that. I'm still trying to figure it out,\" the 30-year-old Super Bowl champion said.\\n\"I was just doing what my uncle always told me to do if I was in a situation like that - just listen, put your hands on the steering wheel. Gotta be careful, man.\\n\"They said I was speeding, but I don't know. They said I was speeding, reckless driving, whatever.\"\\nWhen informed by a reporter that one of the police officers had been placed on leave, he added: \"That should tell you everything you need to know.\"\\nHill said he wanted to use his platform to make sure there was a \"positive\" outcome from the incident for himself and the police.\\nHe added: \"I do want to use this platform to say 'What if I wasn't Tyreek Hill?' \\n\"Everybody has bad apples in every situation, but I want to be able to use this platform to figure out a way to flip this and make it a positive on both ends, my end and Miami-Dade and that way we can team together and do something positive for the community.\"\\nIn a statement, Miami-Dade Police Department director Stephanie V Daniels said: \"I initiated an internal affairs investigation to ensure a thorough review of the matter.\\n\"One of the officers involved in the incident has been placed on administrative duties while the investigation is conducted.\\n\"I'm committed to transparency and accountability to the community with any situation involving my officers.\"\\nEarlier, Hill's agent Drew Rosenhaus told ESPN, external it had been a \"heartbreaking situation\" but Hill was OK.\\nRosenhaus said: \"How things escalated into the situation they were in - handcuffs and being held on the ground by police - is mind-boggling to me. \\n\"I'm deeply concerned by that, very troubled. We will be looking into it.\"\\nHe added: \"This is crazy, I've never seen anything like it.\"\\nOn Monday, a police union for Miami-Dade officers issued a statement saying Hill was \"uncooperative\" and \"initiated\" the incident which led to him being handcuffed.\\n\"First, to be clear, at no time was he ever under arrest. He was briefly detained for officer safety, after driving in a manner in which he was putting himself and others in great risk of danger,\" read the statement from South Florida Police Benevolent Association president Steadman Stahl.\\n\"Upon being stopped, Mr Hill was not immediately cooperative with the officers on the scene who, pursuant to policy and for their immediate safety, placed Mr Hill in handcuffs.\\n\"Mr Hill, still uncooperative, refused to sit on the ground and was therefore redirected to the ground.\"\\n  \n",

professional football on Sunday, as the two-time World Cup winner played her final game in the National Women's Soccer League. \\nMorgan, 35, announced her retirement last week after learning she is pregnant with her second child.\\nShe captained the San Diego Wave in a 4-1 home defeat by North Carolina Courage. \\nMorgan, whose daughter Charlie was born in 2020, missed a 10th-minute penalty before being substituted three minutes later to a standing ovation by the 26,516 fans in attendance.\\nAddressing the crowd after the game, she said: \"What a ride it's been.\"\\nMorgan has played at the top level of the women's game for 15 years and was part of the USA teams that won two successive World Cups in 2015 and 2019.\\nShe also claimed a gold medal with her country at the 2012 London Olympics.\\n\"I want to thank my team-mates who have constantly challenged me every day and made me better,\" she added.\\n\"There have been so many incredible moments in my career but this last moment I share on the field with you I will cherish forever. So from the bottom of my heart, thank you.\"\\nMorgan made her international debut in 2009 and has played 224 matches for the USA, scoring 123 goals - the fifth-best of all time. However, she was not included in new manager Emma Hayes' squad for the 2024 Paris Games, where they won gold. \\nShe has been a strong advocate for gender equality in football and in 2019, together with other players in the national team, filed a discrimination lawsuit against US Soccer regarding equal pay, with an agreement reached in 2022. \\nIn her club career, she won a league title with Portland in 2013 before joining Lyon in January 2017, where she helped the French club win a treble, including the Women's Champions League. \\nShe also had a brief three-month spell with Tottenham in the Women's Super League in 2020. \\n  \n",

Rodrygo says he is disappointed he did not make the 30-man shortlist for the 2024 Ballon d'Or. \\nThe 23-year-old scored 17 goals and registered nine assists in 51 appearances for the Spanish club last season. \\nBut the Brazil international failed to secure a nomination for the prestigious award, unlike his Madrid team-mates Jude Bellingham and Vinicius Jr. \\n\"I was upset, I think I deserved it,\" Rodrygo told ESPN. , external\\n\"I don't want to belittle the players who are there, I think they deserved it also. But I think I had a place in the 30.\"\\nThe nominees are selected by France Football's editorial team in collaboration with the Ballon d'Or ambassador - former Chelsea and Ivory Coast forward Didier Drogba - and selected members of the media.  \\nThe winner will be announced at a ceremony in Paris on 28 October.\\nRodrygo was part of the Real Madrid side that won the La Liga and Champions League titles last season. \\nAlong with England midfielder Bellingham and fellow Brazil forward Vinicius, Real's Dani Carvajal, Federico Valverde, Antonio Rudiger and the now-retired Toni Kroos were all nominated. \\nFrance striker Kylian Mbappe, who joined Real from Paris St-Germain in the summer when his contract with the French club expired, also made the shortlist. \\nRodrygo cited his versatility across different positions for both club and country as a possible reason for the snub. \\n\"Often, I'm just filling spaces,\" he said. \"Is someone missing there?

                                                  When canoeist Curtis McGrath posted a message on social media last month saying that he would not be participating at the Paris 2024 Paralympics, it initially shocked the Australian public.\\nThe 36-year-old had won three gold medals at the Games and was expected to defend his two titles from Tokyo.\\nBut a quick swipe left on his post on Instagram revealed another picture – one saying that McGrath would be \"competing\" in the French capital, as opposed to \"participating\".\\nThe post was all about changing the language bias used to describe disability sports and Para-athletes in comparison to their Olympics peers.\\n\"We're trying to educate people about the right way we want to be portrayed, perceived and talked about,\" McGrath told the BBC World Service.\\n\"I think in the past we've always seen the Paralympics as this little event on the end of the Olympics for the disabled people to come along.\\n\"We are elite athletes and we come here to compete and represent our countries to the highest level within our standard within our sport.\"\\nMcGrath's message was part of a campaign by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC), and the organisation's chief brand and communications officer Craig Spence said the Paris Games were the time to \"set the record straight\" on how society should talk about Para-athletes.\\n\"Language plays an instrumental role in how people are perceived, especially when it comes to persons with disabilities and Paralympians,\" Spence added.\\nMcGrath defended his kayak KL3 title in Paris but an illustration of the IPC's campaign came when he missed out on a bronze medal in the Va'a VL3 category by six hundredths of a second.\\n\"It's a world-class competition out there,\" McGrath said.\\nArgentine wheelchair tennis player Gustavo Fernandez, Italian sprinter Amber Sabatini and 17-year-old Ugandan swimmer Husnah Kukundakwe were among those who posted the same message as McGrath on social media before the Games.\\n\"It really did open up the minds of people,\" Kukundakwe told BBC Sport Africa.\\n\"For most people, they don't see the Paralympics as the highest sporting event.\\n\"Going in with this [campaign] shows people that it takes lots and lots of hard work for Para-athletes to get to this level and compete with the best in the world.\"\\nMcGrath said he and his fellow competitors had not travelled to Paris for \"participation medals\".\\n\"It needs to be understood that we're not just here to have a little paddle or have a little table tennis game,\" the former soldier from Gold Coast added.\\n\"We are here to compete and beat the best in our field. It's all about making that dialogue controlled by ourselves and our own athletes as well.\\n\"It's about education and if we can change the perspective of one or two people to change the way in which they talk about the Games and talk about disability.\\n\"It's all about high performance and being the best and elite athletes.\"\\nThe closing ceremony of Paris 2024 on Sunday night at the Stade de France threw the focus forward to Los Angeles 2028.\\nThe hope is that the IPC's campaign ensures everyone knows they will be watching competitors – not participants – in the United States in four years' time.\\n  \n",

ParalympicsGB won 49 gold medals as part of a total medal haul of 124.\\nIn and out of the sporting action, there were many moments that will live long in the memory, both for those in action and those spectating.\\nHere are a selection of those moments from the past week and a half in Paris.\\nIn wheelchair tennis, GB’s Alfie Hewett earned a gold and silver medal double in the final days of the Paralympics.\\nHewett, 26, won his men’s doubles final with Gordon Reid on Friday - having lost three Paralympic finals across the previous two Games in Rio de Janeiro and Tokyo. Upon victory, he waved his racquet in the air and embraced Reid following a win he described as the \"stuff of dreams\".\\nHe was back in singles action on Saturday and having suffered a groin injury in the opening game, and then lost the first set 6-2, came back to take Japan’s Tokito Oda to three sets.\\nHewett, who only needed a men’s singles gold to complete a career set of accomplishments, won the second set 6-4, and then had a match point in the decider - but Oda came from 5-3 down to win it 7-5.\\nWhile Hewett would have hoped for two golds, his back-to-back medals and doubles gold are reward for a player who has now featured in five Paralympic finals.\\nThe first of two Sundays at the Paralympics produced 18 medals for ParalympicsGB, including 12 golds.\\nNot only was it their most successful day of the Games, but the most successful this century.\\nThere was an even split across sports, with Para-rowing, Para-cycling, Para-athletics and Para-swimming all producing multiple medals, including a first of the Games for Hannah Cockroft in the women’s T34 100m final.\\nIt was not just individuals who stood out, with GB’s golden Sunday including mixed double sculls, mixed coxed four, mixed team sprint and mixed freestyle triumphs.\\nGreat Britain started day four with 11 golds and 26 medals, ending it with 23 golds and 44 medals.\\nMore than a third of ParalympicsGB’s gold medals - 18 out of 49 - came in the pool.\\nGreat Britain’s young squad of swimmers included the duo of Poppy Maskill, 19, and Alice Tai, 25, who won five medals each.\\nFor debutant Maskill in particular, it was a Games to remember. She entered five events and won three golds and two silvers across S14 individual events, as well as the mixed team freestyle relay.\\nThere were two S12 golds for Stephen Clegg in 100m events - the backstroke and butterfly finals - adding to the three medals he won in Tokyo three years ago.\\nWilliam Ellard, 18, won two golds and a silver, while Maisie Summers-Newton, 22, and Tully Kearney, 27, also provided Great Britain with a pair of gold medals each.\\nBritain won swimming medals on all 10 full days of the Paralympics, all but one of which included at least one gold.\\nThe opening day of the Games in Paris bought heartbreak from Kadeena Cox, one of ParalympicsGB's star names heading into this summer.\\nIn the women’s C1-5 500m time trial, where Cox was among the favourites, she struggled to get rhythm on the bike and fell off within seconds of her start, unable to finish the race.\\nCox was helped off the track in tears following the crash, which she described as a “nightmare”.\\nKeen to make up for her singles disappointment in the team event three days later, she helped GB win gold on Super Sunday alongside Jody Cundy and Jaco van Gass in the mixed C1-5 750m team sprint final.\\nCox's gold was her seventh career Paralympic medal.\\nParalympicsGB's squad consisted of a wide range of experienced competitors, as well as a look at the next generation, who delivered plenty of medals.\\nSarah Storey extended her run as Great Britain's most-decorated Paralympian. At 46, she won golds in the women’s C4-5 road race and C5 time trial, taking her to 19 Paralympic golds and 30 medals in total.\\nHannah Cockroft, 32, competing at her fourth career Games, continued her perfect record of T34 gold medals, winning over 100 and 800 metres.
