McLaren ask Piastri to back Norris title bid,Andrew Benson,2024-09-12T05:08:10.985Z,https://www.bbc.com/sport/formula1/articles/c4gen1vegx7o,"McLaren are to prioritise Lando Norris over team-mate Oscar Piastri in their bid to win both Formula 1 world championships this year.
But team principal Andrea Stella said any actions taken to back Norris in the drivers' title chase would happen only within the team's principles of sportsmanship and fairness.
Stella told BBC Sport: ""The overall concept is we are incredibly determined to win, but we want to win in the right way.""
Norris heads into this weekend's Azerbaijan Grand Prix 62 points behind Red Bull's Max Verstappen in the drivers' championship with a maximum of 232 still available.
Piastri is in fourth place in the championship, 106 points behind Verstappen.
Stella, speaking in an exclusive interview, said: ""We [will] bias our support to Lando but we want to do it without too much compromise on our principles.
""Our principles are that the team interest always comes first. Sportsmanship for us is important in the overall way we go racing. And then we want to be fair to both drivers.""
Until now, McLaren had allowed Norris and Piastri to race each other without interference from the team.
The shift in policy towards finding ways to boost Norris' chances of beating Verstappen to the drivers' title comes after a series of meetings between McLaren bosses and their drivers following the Italian Grand Prix.
In Monza, Norris and Piastri qualified first and second but the Australian overtook the Briton on the first lap and the incident led to Ferrari's Charles Leclerc getting between the two McLarens. Leclerc went on to win the race, from Piastri and Norris. Verstappen finished an uncompetitive sixth.
Stella said: ""What we don't want to see any more is a situation like in Monza in which we enter a chicane P1/P2 and we exit P1/P3. Because that is a detriment to the team.
""The team interests comes first and these are the situations that above all we need to fix because eventually, as a matter of fact, the way we entered the race in Monza left the door open this situation.
""After Monza, three objectives: we need to make sure that anything that happens on track is not to the detriment of the team.
""Second objective, how do we win both championships, both drivers committed to help?
""But what we don't want to do is win in a reckless way.
""Those are the three topics and they define the way we go racing in Baku. This will be updated after Baku.""
Verstappen dominated the first part of the season, and has taken seven victories, when no other driver has more than two wins.
But the Dutchman has not won for six races, since the Spanish Grand Prix in June, and Red Bull admit they are lost in understanding why their car has fallen back in terms of performance compared to McLaren, Ferrari and Mercedes
Stella said both McLaren drivers had bought into the shift in philosophy.
""The conversations have been very collaborative,"" he said.
""Even when I said to Oscar: 'Would you be available to give up a victory?' He said: 'It's painful, but if it's the right thing to do now, I will do it'.
""Every driver is hard-wired to go for a victory. So I am always very impressed by the level of team spirit and maturity and collaboration that we found in this period.""
Stella refused to give details of the sort of choices that might be made in Norris' favour but said decisions would be made on an ad hoc basis as to whether any interference between the two drivers was ""worthwhile"".
And he emphasised that Norris was on board with the idea of not going all out in acting in his favour in every way.
""Lando wants to win because he deserved the victory on track,"" Stella said.
""It's OK to be occasionally supported by your team-mate, but you don't want to use, systematically, ways of adjusting the race just for the sake of the points when your team-mate is scoring in a way that he deserves. This is not the way McLaren want to win, or the way Lando wants to win.
""If I ask Lando, he would say: 'I am comfortable if in Abu Dhabi [at the end of the season] I miss a few points that I could have got with some actions, but if those actions were not right at the time, then, you know what? We keep strong as a team, the team is stable and cohesive, we will give it a go next year'.""
In the constructors' championship, McLaren are just eight points behind Red Bull and could take the lead this weekend. Ferrari are in third place, 31 adrift of McLaren.
Stella emphasised: ""We need to be careful that while we focus the conversation and the attention on to the drivers’, we don't lose sight on the fact that the constructors’ is at least a three-headed quest.""
Stella said this changed approach from McLaren was distinct from the so-called ""papaya rules"", a phrase used by Norris’ engineer Will Joseph over the team radio in Italy as a shorthand for the drivers' rules of engagement with each other on track.
Stella said: ""The 'papaya rules' only have to do with racing with no risks, no contact between the two McLarens and respectfully. That's it.
""It's just a quick way to remind our drivers, 'Guys, don't take too much risk in fighting each other'.""

How 'Slotball' varies from Klopp's rock 'n' roll,Emlyn Begley,2024-09-12T07:44:32.282Z,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c4geyjml92eo,"Arne Slot has done something at Liverpool that Jurgen Klopp managed only once in eight full seasons in charge: win the opening three Premier League games without conceding.
The former Feyenoord boss had big boots to fill when he replaced Klopp, who won the Champions League and Premier League with the Reds.
Fans were not sure how the team would fare with a new manager, but the early signs are good.
""The most impressive thing is that Slot has come in - understated and cool - and they have slightly changed the way they play as it is not so frantic,"" says BBC pundit Chris Sutton.
""They were great to watch under Jurgen Klopp but there seems to be greater control.""
It appears like Liverpool might have shored up their leaky defence too.
BBC Sport looks at what is different and what has stayed the same.
Liverpool's only summer signing to join up with the team immediately was Juventus winger Federico Chiesa, who is yet to make his debut.
That means the team that Slot has put out was the one available to Klopp - but with a few fringe players gone, plus centre-back Joel Matip.
Fans bemoaned the failure to sign a defensive midfielder - specifically Real Sociedad's Martin Zubimendi - but Slot's fellow Dutchman Ryan Gravenberch has excelled in that role so far despite starting only 12 games last season.
""All of the club talk in the summer transfer window was about getting a defensive midfielder in, but in the opening games all of the players who have been put there have been so intelligent,"" former Blackburn and Celtic striker Sutton told BBC Radio 5 Live.
""They have shown that the number six position will not be too much of a problem because they have talent that is adaptable.""
Diogo Jota has also been preferred to Darwin Nunez up front this season. Last season Nunez started more games than the Portuguese. 
Formation-wise, Slot is going with a 4-2-3-1 compared to Klopp's 4-3-3.
The main difference is two more defensive midfielders - Gravenberch and Alexis Mac Allister - with Dominik Szoboszlai playing further forward than before.
The only real change Slot has made between games was Ibrahima Konate replacing Jarrell Quansah at half-time in the opener against Ipswich and keeping his place after that.
Liverpool have won their first three league games by an aggregate 7-0, including a 3-0 win at Manchester United.
The only time Klopp managed three opening wins and three clean sheets was in 2018-19, also by a combined 7-0. That season they started off with six wins and 20 games unbeaten - and finished second on 97 points.
Liverpool have had a more patient build-up this season under Slot, with more passing at the back.
More of Liverpool's touches have come in their own penalty area - 11% compared to 6% last season - with more touches just in front of the box too.
The number of touches in the opposition penalty area is slightly higher too.
Albeit with a limited data set of three games, Klopp's side last season - averaged over 38 games - have better figures than Slot's team over several metrics.
Klopp's side had the edge per game on possession (61% compared to Slot's 57%), shots (21 v 16), passes (593 v 545), passes forward (189 v 168), direct attacks (2.6 v 1) and high turnovers (10 v 9).
Slot's side have slightly better passing accuracy (88% compared to Klopp's 86%) and face fewer shots (8 v 11).
The shots faced, and the fact they have not conceded, also indicates they are dealing with some of the issues that meant they conceded 41 league goals last season. 
Goals scored are the same between both managers - 2.3 per game.
""The main difference appears to be their defensive solidity,"" said BBC Radio Merseyside's Ian Kennedy.
""Klopp's teams had no problems scoring goals and winning games, but had a tendency to concede too.
""This season the team are making sure they have players back in numbers if they lose possession and are not caught in transition.
""Liverpool still press, but maybe it's a slightly more controlled, more cautious approach.""
BBC Sport chief football writer Phil McNulty says ""the signs are good"".
""Slot is doing it his way without trying to be Klopp. He also has an air of authority,"" he said.
 ""While it is very much business as usual, there are also subtle differences.
""Liverpool look a bit more controlled under Slot as opposed to the thrilling, but occasionally chaotic, approach under Klopp - that did bring great success.""
Liverpool's star attacker of the Klopp era, Mohamed Salah, has started this season in great form with a goal in each game.
Before the win over United he told the Liverpool website:, external ""It's quite different to before. Now we are trying to control the ball all the time.
""Before it wasn't really the number one thing, because with Jurgen most of the time we tried to counter-attack or counter-press and try to win the ball as high as possible.
""We're still doing that, but also when you have the ball you have more time to keep the ball and just try to move the ball around.""

Going strong at 37 - the FA Cup record breaker who faced Man Utd in final,Neil Johnston,2024-09-12T07:15:39.507Z,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c70jv09v1xpo,"""At the time I didn't understand how big an occasion it was,"" says Curtis Weston. ""Looking back now, it was a massive moment in my life even though it only lasted a few minutes.""
In 2004 Weston made history when he became the youngest player to appear in an FA Cup final aged 17 years and 119 days.
It is a record that remains to this day.
Millwall trailed Manchester United 3-0 at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff when Weston came on for player-manager Dennis Wise in the 89th minute.
It was only the second senior appearance of his career.
Twenty years on and the veteran of 300-plus Football League appearances is getting ready to play for non-league Derbyshire side Mickleover against Anstey Nomads in the second qualifying round of the FA Cup on Saturday (15:00 BST).
""The second qualifying round is a long, long way from the final,"" midfielder Weston, 37, tells BBC Sport.
""But playing in the FA Cup still brings me an awful lot of pleasure."" 
London-born Weston grew up a Manchester United fan and joined Millwall at the age of 14.
Twenty years ago he had not even made his senior debut when they booked their first FA Cup final appearance by defeating First Division rivals Sunderland 1-0 in the semi-final at Old Trafford.
Thirteen days before the final, Weston came on as a second-half substitute in the final league match of the season, a 1-0 home win over Bradford City.
He remembers the elation he felt after discovering soon after that he had made the cup final squad and would be travelling to the showpiece with the likes of Tim Cahill, Neil Harris and Wise.
""Don't forget I was 17, a kid, and I was going to the FA Cup final,"" he says. ""It was a great achievement in itself to be named in the squad.
""It was only on the day of the final I was told I was going to be on the bench. I was surprised, shocked, so excited.""
Manchester United's team that day included a 19-year-old Cristiano Ronaldo, Roy Keane, Ruud van Nistelrooy, Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs. 
""I spent as much time as possible warming up on the side of the pitch to soak up the atmosphere, getting close to the action because Ronaldo was doing all his tricks,"" recalls Weston.
United, the hot favourites, were in complete control thanks to goals by Ronaldo and Van Nistelrooy (2) when Weston's big moment arrived.
""Dennis shouted towards Ray Wilkins [his assistant] that he was coming off and the kid should come on. So Ray called me over and told me to get ready. 
""I was nervous even though there were only a few minutes left.""
As Wise came off he embraced Weston and told the youngster to ""go and enjoy yourself"".
""I will never forget it,"" says Weston. ""I sneaked into the squad at the end of Millwall's FA Cup journey having not played a minute of the other ties.""
Weston went on to spend a further two years at Millwall before following Wise to Swindon Town and then Leeds United.
In 2009, he won promotion with Gillingham at Wembley in the League Two play-off final. More recently, Weston captained Chesterfield against Chelsea in the FA Cup at Stamford Bridge.
Weston will celebrate his 38th birthday in January with no thoughts of retirement.
Around 12 years ago he changed his nutrition and made some lifestyle changes to prolong his career.
""Had I carried on doing what I was doing I probably would have been forced to retire years ago,"" adds Weston, who lives in Derby with wife Hannah and three children Tabitha, 17, Zachariah, 5, and Marcy, 2.
""I didn't always do everything I was supposed to do in terms of giving myself the best possible chance of playing at the highest level.
""If you give yourself a chance in terms of eating the right things, staying fit and being disciplined, not going out as much... I do the right things now.
""Those changes have enabled me to play this long and feel this good.""
It was only in the summer of 2023 that Weston dropped into part-time football when he signed for Buxton before joining Mickleover,, external who play in the seventh tier Northern Premier League Premier Division, in July.
""Every year I have a chat with Hannah [about whether to carry on playing]. I always say 'this could be my last season' and she just rolls her eyes,"" he laughs.
Weston combines playing with a full-time job in audit recruitment.
""This is my 21st season as a player. Until I lose that drive, I want to keep on playing.""
Weston has Mikael Silvestre's shirt from the 2004 final framed on a wall at his home in Derby, along with his own blue and white number 11 shirt from that day.
They serve as reminders of the day Weston made FA Cup history.
""It's funny because Dennis [Wise] contacted me recently on social media to see how I was doing,"" he adds.
""It's crazy how time flies. I know it's 20 years ago but I remember it all like it was yesterday.""

Australia chief dismisses fears over Lions series,Mike Henson,2024-09-12T09:08:50.903Z,https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/articles/cj0802032pro,"The Wallabies will offer serious competition to the British and Irish Lions next summer, says Rugby Australia chief executive Phil Waugh.
Australia suffered the heaviest defeat in their 125-year Test history on Saturday when they were swept aside 67-27 by Argentina.
It was their third defeat from four games in this year's Rugby Championship and follows a miserable pool-stage exit at last year's Rugby World Cup.
""You can see the progress is there,"" Waugh told the Sydney Morning Herald, external when asked about the team's trajectory before the Lions' arrival Down Under in June.
""It is not nearly where we need it to be, but if we keep progressing at the speed with which we have moved things in the last six months, then there is plenty of time.""
Waugh believes the headline-grabbing scoreline against the Pumas hid the improvements that have been made during new head coach Joe Schmidt's six months in charge.
Australia, who defeated Argentina the week before, led 20-3 in Santa Fe before capitulating in the second half.
They were also within two points of world champions South Africa at half-time of their August meeting before losing 30-12.
""It is a team that is, and I hate using the word 're-building', but it is a team that is re-setting, and it takes experiences in big moments to get better,"" Waugh added.
""Obviously the enormity of the scoreline in that second half [against Argentina] was disappointing. 
""But there is context that is important... we are not the most experienced team in world rugby, and we are building that experience.""
Australia will complete their Rugby Championship campaign with Tests against New Zealand on 21 and 28 September, before taking on England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland in the autumn.
Big-money code-crossing import Joseph Suaalii is set to be among the Australia squad that travels to the northern hemisphere.
The 21-year-old Sydney Roosters wing or centre has been recruited for the 15-man game in a deal reported to be worth more than $5m AUD (£2.6m).
Although he played both codes as a schoolboy, Suaalii is yet to feature in a senior game of rugby union.
""I am honestly not sure [if I will play], but I am going on that tour at the end of the year,"" Suaalii said.
""I know once I finish here I will be straight into it. Footy is footy. It's a footy ball at the end of the day. It's just about playing.""

Arsenal boss Arteta agrees new contract until 2027,Nizaar Kinsella,2024-09-12T07:58:14.988Z,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cwy5ypg3dg3o,"Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta has agreed a new three-year contract with the club.
The Spaniard was set to be out of contract at the end of the season but is now expected to stay until 2027.
The Gunners appointed Arteta, who had been working as a coach under Pep Guardiola at Manchester City at the time, to replace compatriot Unai Emery as boss in December 2019.
He led Arsenal to victory in the FA Cup final at the end of the 2019-2020 campaign to claim his first major trophy as a manager.
Arteta's new deal is expected to be confirmed before Sunday's north London derby at Tottenham.
Arsenal have finished second to Manchester City in the Premier League in the past two seasons as the 42-year-old tries to steer the club to their first top-flight title since 2003-04.
After three games this season Arsenal are fourth, having won their first two matches against Wolves and Aston Villa before being held to a draw by Brighton.
A former midfielder, Arteta made 150 appearances for the Gunners during his playing career and also captained the side. 
BBC Sport football news reporter Nizaar Kinsella
Arsenal have successfully become a force again under manager Mikel Arteta, and a new three-year deal represents a firm backing that he is the man to end the club's wait of more than 20 years for a Premier League title.
It felt like there was little chance he would leave when his contract expired next summer, given the relationships he has built internally and the reassuring calm with which he spoke when discussing the deal.
But previous links to Paris St-Germain and Barcelona perhaps showed the need to tie down Arteta.
The whole machinery at Arsenal behind the scenes is behind both Arteta and sporting director Edu, who have found a way to be competitive against the Manchester City juggernaut - running them close to the title last season.
They also went close in the 2022-23 campaign, but it is now time to take the final step.
After signing Raheem Sterling, Mikel Merino and Riccardo Calafiori the Gunners have again strengthened, though question marks have remained over whether they should have signed a striker.
This is a manager, squad and backroom staff seemingly now capable of winning the biggest titles in England, and it is perhaps symbolic that a new deal comes before a north London derby against Tottenham.

Bentancur charged by FA over Son racial slur,Author not found,2024-09-12T10:01:03.569Z,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c5y3y4e6kn5o,"Tottenham midfielder Rodrigo Bentancur has been charged by the Football Association for using a racial slur about team-mate Son Heung-min.
Appearing on Uruguayan TV in June, Bentancur was asked by a presenter for a Tottenham shirt, before replying: ""Sonny's? It could be Sonny's cousin too as they all look the same.""
Bentancur later apologised on Instagram and said his comments were a ""very bad joke"".
The FA said the 27-year-old Uruguay international had been ""charged with an alleged breach of FA rule E3 for misconduct in relation to a media interview"".
""It's alleged that the Tottenham Hotspur midfielder acted in an improper manner and/or used abusive and/or insulting words and/or brought into disrepute,"" said a statement from English football's governing body.
The FA said this constituted an ""aggravated breach... as it included a reference, whether express or implied, to nationality and/or race and/or ethnic origin"".
In terms of a length of ban, FA laws say, external ""match-based sanctions of 6-12 games will be recommended to regulatory commissions for almost all acts of discrimination by individual participants"".
Bentancur has until Thursday, 19 September to respond to the charge.
At the time, anti-discrimination charity Kick it Out said it had received a ""significant number"" of complaints about Bentancur's racial slur, which highlighted ""a wider issue that heavily affects East Asian and wider communities"".
Son said Bentancur had apologised to him for using a racial slur and the pair have since joined up at Spurs for the Premier League season.
""I've spoken to Lolo,"" said Son in June. ""He made a mistake, he knows this and has apologised.
""Lolo would not mean to ever intentionally say something offensive. We are brothers and nothing has changed at all.
""We're past this, we're united, and we will be back together in pre-season to fight for our club as one.""

Alvarez rules out complacency against Berlanga,Author not found,2024-09-12T10:10:44.832Z,https://www.bbc.com/sport/boxing/articles/c5y5yrjggxpo,"Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez says he wants to show everybody he is still the best when he faces Edgar Berlanga in Las Vegas on Saturday.
Four-weight world champion Alvarez puts his WBO, WBA and WBC super-middleweight titles on the line.
The Mexican boasts a record of 61 wins, two draws and two losses.
""I always take my fights seriously and train 100% no matter who is in there. I always have the same mentality,"" Alvarez said.
""I will show everybody I'm still the best.""
Berlanga, born in New York and of Puerto Rican heritage, is yet to lose in 22 professional fights.
The 27-year-old's last trip to the ring in February ended in victory against Belfast fighter Padraig McCrory.
""There are a lot of doubters out there, people who don't believe in me, but Saturday night I'm going to make them believers,"" Berlanga said.
""There is fire in my blood and veins to go out there and perform. 
""This is the top of the mountain, it doesn't get any bigger, and now it's about me becoming great and putting my last name in the history books forever.""
Alvarez is aiming for his fifth successive victory following defeat against WBA light-heavyweight champion Dmitry Bivol in May 2022.
Saturday's bout takes place at the T-Mobile Arena on the weekend leading up to Mexican Independence Day.
""It is going to be very difficult for him,"" Alvarez said.
""I never overlook any fighter. He is young, a good fighter and is strong, but I've been in there with everybody and have so much experience. I'm strong and have a lot of talent - I'm just the best.""
Matchroom promoter Eddie Hearn, who promotes Berlanga, believes his fighter has an ""underrated IQ"" and is the ""most determined and most confident challenger"".
""Canelo wants a real fight at this stage of his career and he is going to get a real fight,"" Hearn added.
""It's a massive opportunity. This is like the lottery ticket of boxing. We're in Las Vegas where you roll dice, but we're not just looking to roll the dice - we want to collect the ticket as well.""

Ronaldo criticises Ten Hag & says Man Utd must 'rebuild everything',Author not found,2024-09-11T16:41:20.712Z,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/czxlv57v707o,"Cristiano Ronaldo has criticised Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag and said the club must ""rebuild everything"" in order to compete for football's biggest prizes again.
The Dutch boss is under pressure after United's eighth-placed finish last season - their lowest in Premier League history - and two defeats in their opening three games at the start of this campaign.
And Ronaldo, who had two spells at the club before leaving for Saudi Arabian side Al-Nassr, questioned Ten Hag's mentality.
""The coach says they cannot compete to win the [Premier] League and Champions League,"" he told the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast, external, which comes out on Thursday.
""As Manchester United coach, you cannot say that you're not going to fight to win the league or Champions League.
""Mentally [you can] say maybe we don't have that potential, but I cannot say that. We're going to try, you have to try.

""What I wish for Manchester [United], it's what I wish for me - [to be] the best team they can.
""I love that club... I'm not that kind of guy that forgot the past.""
In his six-year first spell at United, Ronaldo won three Premier League titles, the Champions League, two League Cups and an FA Cup - as well as the Fifa Club World Cup and Community Shield - before transferring to Real Madrid in 2009.
He re-joined United from Juventus in August 2021 and scored a total of 145 goals in 346 appearances for the club before he moved to Al-Nassr in December 2022. 
Just a month earlier, Ronaldo had told presenter Piers Morgan he was being ""betrayed"" and pushed out in a controversial television interview.
And speaking to former United team-mate Ferdinand on his podcast, the Portugal forward said there had been ""no evolution"" following former boss Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement in 2013.
United have not won a Premier League title since then, but co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe wants to restore them to their former glories after purchasing a 25% stake in the club and his Ineos team taking over football operations.
Ronaldo added: ""They need to rebuild everything, in my opinion.
""The club needs time to rebuild because it's still one of the best clubs in the world, but they need to change. They understand that this is the only way. 
""This is why they show, they start to change again, the structure of the club, the infrastructures and everything. The owners of the club are investing in the training ground so I'm happy [because things are changing].
""I believe that the future will be bright. I believe, but they don't depend only on the talents. They have to rebuild from the bottom. If not, they cannot compete. It will be impossible.""
Ronaldo, however, has praised the club's decision to recruit another former team-mate Ruud van Nistelrooy to Ten Hag's backroom staff.
""If Ten Hag listens to Ruud, maybe he can [help himself],"" he added.
""I think it can help a lot because he knows the club and the club should listen [to] the guys who were there.
""You [Rio] or Roy Keane or Paul Scholes or Gary Neville [or] Sir Alex Ferguson. You cannot rebuild a club without knowledge - not guys who work in [the] office. 
""The people who understand the football are the people who were there in the dressing room. They know how to deal with the players. 
""So I believe that Ruud is going to help because he was inside the club. He knows the club, he knows the fans. If the coach listens to him, I think they can improve a little bit the club.""

Rahm wants Ryder Cup spot but won't pay fines,Peter Scrivener,2024-09-11T18:58:36.322Z,https://www.bbc.com/sport/golf/articles/cj62l4yrky1o,"Jon Rahm says he has no intention of paying his outstanding DP World Tour fines as the row over his Ryder Cup eligibility rumbles on.
The Spaniard was a pivotal figure in Rome last year as Europe regained the trophy.
But Rahm's involvement in next year's contest against the United States in New York remains in doubt because of his move to LIV Golf.
He was fined for playing Saudi-funded LIV tournaments which conflicted with DP World Tour events, without requesting permission from the European-based tour.
The 29-year-old needs to play in three more tournaments before the season ends in November to retain his membership of the DP World Tour and be eligible to play at Bethpage in 2025.
Rahm has entered the Spanish Open, Dunhill Links Championship and Andalucia Masters, but a DP World Tour spokesman told BBC Sport that until the fines are paid ""he is ineligible to play"".
Speaking on Wednesday at LIV Chicago, Rahm said: ""I'm not a big fan of the fines. I don't intend to pay the fines and we keep trying to have a discussion with them (the DP World Tour) about how we can make this happen.
""I intend to play in Spain. Whether they let me play or not is a different thing.""
European players must play four DP World Tour events a year to retain their membership. Rahm's participation in the Paris Olympic Games counted as one.
There are only two other events he could play in - the French Open and Genesis Championship in South Korea - before the season-ending DP World Tour play-offs in Abu Dhabi and Dubai.
However, Rahm will not have picked up enough points to qualify for the play-offs, with the top 70 in the Race to Dubai rankings playing at the Abu Dhabi Championship before the top 50 contest the DP World Tour Championship in Dubai.
England's Tyrrell Hatton, who teamed up with Rahm to win both their foursomes matches at last year's Ryder Cup, was in a similar position after also joining LIV.
But Rahm's Legion XIII team-mate was allowed to play in last month's British Masters after appealing against his fines.
Players who initially joined LIV in 2022 appealed against their suspensions and fines and were able to compete until April 2023 when an arbitration panel found in favour of the DP World Tour and ratified its right to enforce its regulations.
And former European captain Padraig Harrington insists those rules should be adhered to.
""I'm a stickler for the rules,"" said the 2021 captain, who is at this week's Irish Open. 
""I'm friends with Jon but if the rules are written down, that's just the way it is. The Ryder Cup is bigger than just the match. It is the backbone of the European Tour.
""The European Tour doesn't have a lot of leverage to get players to come back across and play here. The Ryder Cup is the carrot that we use to get people to come back.
""It is a very tough situation for Luke Donald and The Ryder Cup but if the 12th guy who qualifies by sticking to the rules gets bumped out, he's not going to be happy if somebody else has not stuck to the rules. We can't forget that person.""
Speaking in the immediate aftermath of Rahm's seismic move to LIV last December, Rory McIlroy said the European tour ""is going to have to rewrite the rules for Ryder Cup eligibility"" because ""we'd certainly miss and need Jon at Bethpage"".
Europe were thrashed 19-9 at Whistling Straits on their last visit to the US in 2021, and although a 16½-11½ victory in Rome avenged that defeat - with Rahm and Hatton going unbeaten in their four matches - 2025's Ryder Cup in New York promises to be another tough assignment.
However, Donald told BBC Sport last month ""there's not going to be a situation where we're singling out one person to change the rule"".
He added: ""It's quite clear with the policy that you either pay the fines or you can appeal them, and within that appeal time you can still play some DP World Tour events, so Jon absolutely knows what is required.""

Thompson, one of the biggest names in the women’s game over the past decade has been selected as one of Lewis’ three wildcard picks for the match against Europe at the Robert Trent Jones Golf Club, which begins on Friday.
The 29-year-old is making her seventh and final appearance in the competition after announcing her retirement from full-time golf, and Lewis, who played alongside Thompson in three previous editions says she has become synonymous with the event.
“Her legacy, is her and the Solheim Cup,” said Lewis.
“The way she is with the crowd and the fans, this event is Lexi to a tee. She plays better golf here and gets more excited to play golf here. She's going to do whatever it takes to win and I wish I had 12 of her.”
Thompson has won 15 times since turning professional in 2010 and secured her only major title in the 2014 Kraft Nabisco Championship - now renamed the Chevron Championship.
In the Solheim Cup she has claimed 12½ points from her 23 matches, including three from four in last year's thrilling 14-14 draw in Spain that saw Europe retain the trophy.
“She's one of those you could literally pair with anybody,” Lewis added.
“It's a massive void [losing her].  Whoever is the next captain needs to get her as an assistant, that's all I can say.  Lexi needs to be there in the team room.  She needs to be around these girls. She's just great energy to have around.”
Thompson, who has been a fixture for the US since making her debut in 2013, admitted she would be keen on such a role in the future. 
""I'd love to be still a part of it in any way just because I know how special it's been for me,"" she said.
""[I am] learning off the assistants and Stacy of course, and I know there's a lot that goes into it. I'll have to make sure I'm ready for that [but] I'm focusing on the golf part of it right now.""
A partisan crowd is expected to be firmly behind Lewis' team when hostilities on the course get under way on Friday morning. 
And with world number one Nelly Korda and number two Lilia Vu, also at her disposal the hosts are strong favourites to recapture the cup.
The American side also have the added incentive of trying to prevent Europe from retaining the trophy for a record fourth consecutive occasion.
However, Lewis, who has installed a karaoke machine on the team bus to help lighten the atmosphere says her players will not feel any extra pressure to succeed in Virginia.
""It's like getting ready for final exams at school. Hopefully there's a pretty good party on Sunday night,"" she added.
""This team is hungry and they want to have fun doing it. I don't feel any pressure when I'm in that team room or when I'm around the girls. I don't think they feel pressure.
""If we win, we stop the streak. If we lose, the streak keeps going. I would love to stop it, don't get me wrong, but I don't see it as pressure.
""What I've seen at Solheim Cups and teams that I've been on, the ones that are more relaxed [are more successful].""
The Solheim Cup has returned to being played in alternative years from the Ryder Cup as the golf calendar rights itself after it was affected by Covid.
And while Lewis reiterated her comments from last year about both the Solheim and Ryder Cup not doing enough to promote each other when they shared the spotlight in Spain and Italy last year, she conceded she was ""indifferent"" about whether it is better to be in the same year or alternate.
However, she did say she would ""love to see the Presidents Cup become mixed"". 
""It's the perfect way to blend the two Tours and the international team will get better very quickly,"" she added.
The Presidents Cup is a men's matchplay event that sees the United States take on an international team featuring players from the rest of the world outside Europe.
Four of the first six editions of the contest were held at the Robert Trent Jones Golf Club and it has been a one-sided series with the US leading 12-1, with one tied match.
However, while the top two women in the world rankings are American - Nelly Korda and Lilia Vu - the next six would all be eligible to play for the International team.
The next Presidents Cup takes place in Montreal at the end of September.

Time to talk about Bruno - FPL tips & team of the week,Thomas Woods,2024-09-12T06:26:05.991Z,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/ckgj52wz6rjo,"That felt like a long international break! 
Two weeks without Fantasy Premier League is not ideal but at least we have a clear run of four gameweeks before ANOTHER international window.
Oh well, let's forget about that for now and focus on this week's team of the week, which is Crystal Palace and Aston Villa heavy and includes Bruno Fernandes, who is due a return.
The team of the week is selected based on current FPL prices to fit within a £100m budget, as if you were playing a Free Hit.
A week of double digits and one-pointers!
Here's a reminder of gameweek three's team, which scored a respectable 80 points (a gameweek rank of about 1.5m).
No clean sheets - there was only one in week three - and seeing Leandro Trossard hauled off when Arsenal went down to 10 men was a blow.
But Bryan Mbeumo, Mohamed Salah, Erling Haaland and Chris Wood all hauled, while captain Palmer at least returned an assist.
We go again.

Listen to the latest episode of the Fantasy 606 podcast here
Dean Henderson, Crystal Palace, keeper, £4.5m - home to Leicester
Picking a clean sheet has been difficult this season, with only 12 in 30 games so far.
Promoted Leicester and Ipswich are bottom two for expected goals (xG) so far so it makes sense, this early in the season, to back against them scoring.
Brighton face Ipswich and they don't have a clear number-one keeper, so Henderson is in.
Trent Alexander-Arnold, Liverpool, defender, £7m - home to Nottingham Forest
I've said before that Alexander-Arnold is a double-digit return waiting to happen - FPL players know that - so go without him at your peril.
He has an expected goal involvement (xGI) of 1.7 this season with nothing to show for it.
Liverpool have a good chance for a fourth-straight clean sheet v Forest and if this team had the money then pairing Alexander-Arnold with Andy Robertson would be a dreamy move.
Rico Lewis, Manchester City, defender, £4.7m - home to Brentford
Will Lewis continue to keep Kyle Walker out of the City team? 
Who knows but at the moment the young defender is a snip at £4.7m in one of the best three defences in the league.
In the absence of Rodri, Lewis has been inverting into midfield and has found himself in some fantastic attacking positions.
He missed a sitter against Ipswich in week two and has had two big chances. Rodri might be back against Brentford, but Lewis should still thrive.
Lucas Digne, Aston Villa, defender, £4.5m - home to Everton
The French full-back has so far kept summer signing Ian Maatsen out of the Villa team and has been an impressive early season performer.
He has four crosses per game so far, is taking some corners and - with Douglas Luiz gone - could be first choice for direct free-kicks.
Villa have a great run coming up so he is a good pick this week and beyond.
Bruno Fernandes, Manchester United, midfielder, £8.4m - away at Southampton
The underlying statistics are screaming out for us to pick Fernandes this week.
The Manchester United talisman has been unlucky to have no returns so far this season. 
His xGI is two, he has had eight shots (Salah has had just nine and scored three times), four in the box and two big chances.
Couple that with Southampton's defence, which is bottom six for shots conceded, shots in the box conceded, shots on target conceded, expected goals conceded (xGC) and has given up 13 big chances!
Points incoming for Bruno.
Mohamed Salah, Liverpool, midfielder, £12.7m - home to Nottingham Forest
Salah is in this team until his form dips or the fixtures change and this week he is captain over Erling Haaland.
Both juggernauts could get double-digit returns, but Salah edges it with his goals earning more points as a midfielder.
Forest are actually a top-three defence so far based on xGC and shots conceded - and they have allowed a league-lowest 12 shots in the box - so there is a small concern they manage to cramp Liverpool's attacking flair.
That, plus a Champions League away game in Milan after this (potential rotation) and a tight budget are why there's no Liverpool triple-up in this team of the week.
Eberechi Eze, Crystal Palace, midfielder, £6.9m - home to Leicester City
Eze is a steal at £6.9m. He scored last time out at Chelsea with maximum bonus and, bar a refereeing howler on the opening day, should have had two goals in three games.
The England player is a shot monster - 15 this season is the second-most of all midfielders - and we think he is on penalties too.
Leicester have conceded 18 shots on target in three games, Eze has five on target - that equals a decent chance of another goal.
Morgan Rogers, Aston Villa, midfielder, £5.1m - home to Everton
Having a Villa asset feels important this week and Rogers is the next best pick if you can't afford Ollie Watkins (£8.9m).
His two-goal performance for England Under-21s in midweek is a sign of his potential.
Unlike most of the players in this week's team, there are no underlying stats to back-up Rogers' inclusion - sometimes you have to go with your gut and the eye test!
Erling Haaland, Manchester City, striker, £15.2m - home to Brentford
The only questions around Haaland are whether you are going to captain him and whether you think you can get more points from the assets you could have if you weren't spending £15.2m on a striker.
This team, for example, could have Watkins and Luis Diaz in it and every manager will have the same conundrum.
But on current form it is hard to see Haaland not scoring at least once so why back against him?
Joao Pedro, Brighton, striker, £5.7m - home to Ipswich
You don't need any special insight to look at Brighton's game at home to Ipswich and sense a chance for a decent Seagulls win.
Pedro and his strike partner Danny Welbeck have both had excellent starts to the season and the latter slightly edges it on underlying data.
But Pedro is on penalties which means he gets the nod - both are decent picks this week.
Jean-Philippe Mateta, Crystal Palace, striker, £7.4m - home to Leicester City
If you hadn't guessed already, I really fancy Palace to score a few this week - sorry Leicester!
Mateta hasn't hit form yet this season and Eddie Nketiah is waiting in the wings to take his place but it's more likely both play rather than the Frenchman loses his place.
Palace haven't quite been the same without Michael Olise but they have under-performed their xG this season by a full goal and Mateta has 13 in his past 16 Premier League games.
Lukasz Fabianski, West Ham, keeper, £4m - away to Fulham
A £4m keeper who might play if Alphonse Areola's injury lingers.
Lewis Dunk, Brighton, defender, £4.5m - home to Ipswich
A great first sub against Ipswich who also has a goal in him
Tim Iroegbunam, Everton, midfielder, £4.5m - away to Aston Villa
Has played every game for the Toffees since a summer move from Villa, four shots in three games.
Taylor Harwood-Bellis, Southampton, defender, £4m - home to Manchester United
A £4m defender who plays. Ideal third sub.

Total team cost: £99.1m

Abdul Fatawu, Leicester City, midfielder, £5.5m
Fancy a budget midfielder who faces Everton, Bournemouth and Forest at home and Southampton and Ipswich away in his next seven games?
Then look no further than the Ghanaian who is down as a midfielder but plays right wing.
He's had the most shots and the highest xGI of any Leicester midfielder.
Everton - Aston Villa (a), Leicester (a), Crystal Palace (h)
After Villa this week, the Toffees' next eight fixtures are pretty welcoming, including matches against all three promoted teams.
Everton provide good budget options too if you are looking to position your squad to be able to afford a few big hitters.
Dominic Calvert-Lewin at £5.9m is not a bad shout and you could do worse than getting in someone like Vitaliy Mykolenko (£4.4m) as your fourth defender.
Chris Sutton continues to march to his own tune and is determined to go through the season without owning either Erling Haaland or Mo Salah, but Statman Dave and I have both decided to do entirely the opposite, for the next couple of weeks at least, by owning the pair of them.
We’ve both added Salah to our squads this week – I’ve sold Son Heung-Min, Dave’s sold Bukayo Saka and we’ve both had to drop Alexander Isak down to a cheaper striker, but we’re tempted by Liverpool’s next two fixtures, both at Anfield against Nottingham Forest and Bournemouth.
It’s also about being able to turn to Salah as captain in gameweek five, when Haaland comes up against the Arsenal defence.
Salah is then likely to leave my squad as I use my first wildcard in gameweek six, when Saka will become part of an Arsenal triple-up before a nice run of fixtures.
If you’re also thinking about playing the wildcard in gameweek six and your squad’s in decent shape then you could use the next two weeks to take a punt on a couple of differentials - some suggestions would be Crystal Palace’s Daniel Munoz in defence, Brighton’s Yankuba Minteh in midfield and maybe even Jhon Duran up front for Aston Villa’s home games against Everton and Wolves.
The amount of game-time he gets is the obvious risk there but he hasn’t needed many minutes to score his goals so far this season.
Meanwhile, the manager of our listeners’ team has gone for an Aston Villa defender this week with Pau Torres coming in for Lewis Hall.

New-look England beaten by Australia in first T20,Sam Drury,2024-09-11T21:16:37.604Z,https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/cn7l0n8e8vjo,"First T20, Utilita Bowl, Southampton
Australia 179 (19.3 overs): Head 59 (23), Short 41 (26); Livingstone 3-22
England 151 (19.2 overs): Livingstone 37 (27); Abbott 3-28, Zampa 2-20
Australia won by 28 runs
Scorecard
A new-look England side slumped to a 28-run defeat by Australia in the first T20 international at Utilita Bowl.
Australia made a blistering start, with Travis Head smashing 59 from 23 balls as he and opening partner Matthew Short put on 86 in the first six overs.
But England, who handed T20 debuts to three players and were captained by Phil Salt for the first time, produced a superb fightback to bowl the tourists out for 179.
The spinners led the way, with Liam Livingstone taking 3-22 and Adil Rashid impressive for his 1-23, while seamers Jofra Archer and Saqib Mahmood claimed two wickets apiece.
However, England's chase was in trouble early as three wickets went down in the powerplay.
Livingstone and Sam Curran gave them hope with a 54-run stand for the fifth wicket  but when they departed in quick succession, England's long tail was exposed and they were bowled out for 151 in the final over.
The teams will now head to Cardiff for the second T20 on Friday before the three-match series concludes at Old Trafford on Sunday.
Australia’s openers marmalised the England seamers early on, the home fans only cheering ironically when a delivery was not dispatched to the boundary.
Short started the onslaught with back-to-back towering sixes off Reece Topley before Head – who successfully reviewed after being given out caught behind – went one better with three in a row as he pummelled 30 off a Curran over.
With long square boundaries at Southampton, England tried to bowl short but were punished time and again as Head raced to a 19-ball half-century – the fastest for Australia in T20s and the quickest against England in the format.
He fell to Mahmood from the last ball of the powerplay but Australia still appeared on for a monstrous total.
A much-changed England side turned to their most experienced bowler and Rashid delivered, bowling Mitchell Marsh in his first over.
Livingstone replaced Rashid as England clawed back control by bowling 10 straight overs of spin and the all-rounder had Short caught on the sweep off his second ball.
When Livingstone trapped Marcus Stoinis and Tim David lbw with back-to-back deliveries – both times on review – the hosts were right back in the game.
Josh Inglis kept Australia steady before he was bowled trying to reverse scoop Curran and it was left to Archer and Mahmood to mop up the tail.
Three yorkers in three balls brought three wickets, two for Archer and one for Mahmood - both of whom narrowly missed out on hat-tricks – and Adam Zampa was run out as the tourists failed to bat their overs.
Ultimately, the late collapse did not cost Australia as there were no fireworks from England.
Salt was reprieved by being caught off a no-ball first up but there was no such luck for Will Jacks as he picked out Short at fine leg in the next over.
Debutant Jordan Cox and Salt both fell before the end of the powerplay and when Zampa bowled Jacob Bethell, also making his international debut, England were struggling at 52-4.
Livingstone and Curran were happy to bide their time and try to rebuild but just as they started to accelerate, Sean Abbott had Curran caught at short fine leg.
Josh Hazlewood bowled Livingstone, who played well for his 37 from 27 balls, three deliveries later and from there England looked beaten.
The wily Zampa bowled Jamie Overton, on his T20I debut, leaving the England bowlers to try and rescue the situation for the second time in the match.
They took the game into the last over without ever threatening to overhaul Australia’s total.
England must hope a top seven, which included all three debutants and is missing skipper Jos Buttler, learn quickly against a top-class opponent to turn the series around.
Australia’s main concern will be over the fitness of fast bowler Xavier Bartlett, who pulled up with two balls left of his final over and must now be a doubt for the matches in Cardiff and Manchester.
Player of the match, Australia batter Travis Head: ""It was a nice start. Nice to get under way.
""To set a platform like that with the hitters we had behind us, it was nice to do the job.""
England captain Phil Salt: ""Everything was good apart from the result. They played well. Travis Head came out swinging in the powerplay and gave them a head start.
""Australia did bowl well. At times we could have taken partnerships deeper.""
Australia captain Mitchell Marsh: ""We certainly looked on course for 200 but did our best to stuff it up, so it's nice to start the series with a win.""

Chelsea ownership rift exposed and explained,Nizaar Kinsella,2024-09-11T12:17:08.922Z,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c4gvnjvgmm0o,"Chelsea have two owners wanting to buy each other out. Neither wants to sell, amid a rift at the heart of the club. 
In one corner is Todd Boehly, often mischaracterised as the main man and decision-maker of the ownership, mainly because he had a very public-facing role when Chelsea was taken over and made outlandish public comments, including the proposal of a Premier League all-star game. 
Boehly, who also owns the LA Dodgers baseball team, was first revealed in a Bloomberg report last week to want to buy out his rivals at Clearlake Capital. 
Despite his frontman profile, Boehly is a minority investor and has only a 12.8% stake - the same as allies and fellow billionaires Mark Walter and Hansjorg Wyss, which limits his power to force the issue.
In the other corner is Behdad Eghbali, who is really the most active and powerful figure at Stamford Bridge, as co-founder of private equity firm Clearlake, the company which owns a majority 61.5% stake in the club.
He is aligned with fellow Clearlake co-founder Jose E Feliciano as powerful figures who are adamant that they do not want to sell and are only looking to increase their stake.
They are willing to be patient while in control of Chelsea, while Boehly is believed to want a resolution within the next two months.
This ownership group - thrust together in order to buy Chelsea after sanctions were placed on former owner Roman Abramovich by the UK government because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine - is now fractured into two clear camps.
In truth, the issues with the Boehly and Clearlake co-ownership have been suspected in football circles for some time.
But, with the awkward truth now laid bare, the question of how a group which invested £2.5bn to buy the club, while committing a further £1.75bn in spending, resolves this stand-off now comes into sharper focus
This Game of Thrones-like situation throws back to early 2022 when Abramovich was forced to sell Chelsea rapidly. 
Boehly earned fame through the bidding process, was made chairman until 2027 and appointed himself interim sporting director. 
In a dramatic, chaotic start to the ownership Chelsea spent big, signing Raheem Sterling, Wesley Fofana, Marc Cucurella, Kalidou Koulibaly and Pierre Emerick Aubameyang in a £255m spend under Boehly's initial leadership.
Thomas Tuchel was then sacked and replaced by Graham Potter in September 2022 after a joint-review from both sides of the ownership 100 days into their tenure. But that call was ultimately led by Boehly, with Potter lined up as the replacement before Tuchel was sacked.
When Boehly stepped down as sporting director in January 2023 - to be replaced by former Brighton duo Paul Winstanley and Laurence Stewart - Eghbali began gaining control.
He involved himself in deals to sign Mykhailo Mudryk for £89m and Enzo Fernandez for £107m in a record £320m January transfer window.
The divide began to grow around the end of the 2022-23 season, when Chelsea finished 12th, their worst finish in the Premier League era. Boehly entered the dressing room to give a public dressing down to the squad following the defeat by Brighton.
Sterling is believed to have taken the brunt of his criticism, and Boehly took a step back from day-to-day running of the club.
Eghbali assumed more control in the following months, although the decision to appoint Mauricio Pochettino as manager was made by both owners, alongside the co-sporting directors.
Those aligned with Boehly on the club's board also continued to back Pochettino after a strong finish to the 2023-24 season as they finished sixth in the league despite an inconsistent campaign.
But, to the surprise of many outside the Chelsea boardroom, Eghbali and the club's sporting directors completed a two-day review, after which the popular Argentine left by mutual consent on 21 May.
In an interview at a Sportico conference two weeks earlier, Boehly had been asked about Pochettino’s future and replied: ""The number one thing is you have got to be patient.
""You are putting something together and expecting it to come together really quickly, but the reality is anything really good takes a little bit (of) time. Patience was always a thought for us.""
Boehly and Pochettino had dinner together on 17 May. However, Eghbali and his sporting directors were readying for a post-season review which ultimately led to a change of manager.
There was a lack of shared vision between Eghbali, Winstanley and Laurence with Pochettino about future transfer strategy, playing style and the building of a new set-piece department - and an exit by 'mutual consent' was agreed upon.
On a wider point, under the current co-ownership, Chelsea have spent more than £1.5bn on transfers in five windows as almost every senior player from the Abramovich era has left or been sold, alongside the majority from the first Boehly-controlled window in 2022.
That chaotic pace of change has been felt by players and first-team staff alike.
Figures within Clearlake insist that will now slow down as they back new manager Enzo Maresca with a five-year deal and believe him to be aligned with their, and the sporting directors', vision. 
Of course, much hinges on his success, but some early signs are positive as Chelsea target Champions League qualification in this new 2024-25 campaign.
Boehly still made his presence felt in the same directors' box as Eghbali when Chelsea lost 2-0 to Manchester City in the opening Premier League match of the season.
The gradual worsening of relations has been described as a ""culture clash"" rather than a major blow-up.
There are complaints from sources on one side that Eghbali is too involved on the football side of the operation on a day-to-day basis and needs to leave the experts to do their job.
But Clearlake insists that he only helps on the financial side of deals and allows analysts and sporting directors to lead. 
Boehly's camp would point to his hands-off approach at the successful LA Dodgers in baseball, where he was not involved in the sporting operation.
In truth, both owners are somewhat culpable for what has, at times, become an oversized squad, having lurched between different transfer strategies in a relatively short period.
On the positive side, Chelsea say they have modernised the medical and recruitment departments, with work on the academy and training ground to begin soon. 
Newly promoted club president Jason Gannon has taken the lead on the stadium project from board member Jonathan Goldstein, CEO of Boehly's investment firm Cain International.
Although Goldstein remains involved, the accomplished Gannon, who has experience working as managing director of SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles, is in charge. Architect Janet Marie Smith, who continues to work with Boehly on Dodger Stadium, has left, with Populous now advising on design possibilities. 
However, the ownership issues and change in senior executive staff has significantly slowed work on ground redevelopment or a move to a new stadium, with the aim of expanding the 40,000-seater Stamford Bridge by 2030 now in doubt.
It has also been a factor in no front-of-shirt sponsorship deal being secured for the start of the second season in a row. 
Yet the women's team, which have had less intervention from the owners, remain a success as they seek a minority investor to buy into that side of the club, which has split from the first team.
Sources inside the men's first team insist the public ownership spat will not undermine performances on the pitch, while the women's team say they have never been impacted.
There are four possible outcomes: 
Boehly buys Clearlake's stake.
Clearlake buys out Boehly and company.
A stalemate where an unhappy alliance continues or issues are partly resolved.
A third party gets involved.
However, this is far more complicated than just two 'warring parties'. 
Both Boehly and Clearlake have veto power over an array of major decisions, including the sales of shares to third parties.
As majority investors, Clearlake appears to have the upper hand, but Boehly could bank on Eghbali and Feliciano being answerable to shareholders should an offer come in that tempts them.
All available evidence suggests Boehly may make a speculative bid to buy shares from Clearlake to test the waters - and any bid would help set a valuation of the club, which is expected to increase from the £2.5bn when it was bought.
Amid such high stakes financially, both sides privately accuse the other of posturing.
Boehly has had a long-held plan to buy a Premier League team after first exploring the chance to buy Tottenham before the 2020 Covid pandemic, while Eghbali's daily involvement displays his passion for the Chelsea project.
This eruption around the ownership situation will ultimately be solved off the pitch, with money deciding the outcome through the banks and the boardroom.

England's Carsley plays down 'impossible job' tag,Author not found,2024-09-11T21:49:25.760Z,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cjw3jenpznqo,"Being England boss is not the ""impossible job"" but ""a really good one"", says interim boss Lee Carsley.
Victory at the 1966 World Cup remains England men's only major title after Carsley's predecessor Gareth Southgate led the side to consecutive European Championship finals.
Carsley was promoted from coaching England's Under-21s after Southgate's resignation following Euro 2024, but two wins from his opening two games in the Nations League have boosted his chances of being named permanent manager.
The Three Lions beat the Republic of Ireland 2-0 in Dublin before overcoming Finland by the same scoreline at Wembley as England played with greater attacking freedom than on their run to the Euro 2024 final.
Carsley's current role has been called ""An Impossible Job"" after the 1994 documentary filmed during Graham Taylor's tenure in charge of England, but Carsley says he is unaware of the reference.
""I’ve not heard that one, no,"" Carsley said, when asked about it.
Even before that documentary the role had been characterised as an 'impossible' one given the intense scrutiny the manger faces from the press and public. 
Carsley came in for criticism before his side had even kicked a ball with him at the helm for saying he had never sung the national anthem before games as he wanted to focus on the match, and would not be changing his position on that.
""I think it’s a really good job,"" he added. ""It's a job where, when you look at different opportunities, the first thing you think is: 'Can you win? Can you be in a position where you can win?' This job definitely ticks that box.
""We've got the players to not only be competitive, but to win a major trophy.""
When Carsley was appointed as interim manager, the FA said it was ""with a view to remaining in the position throughout autumn while the FA's recruitment process for a new permanent head coach continues"".
England have four more Nations League games this year, two in October and two in November.
Meanwhile, defender John Stones says he has been impressed by Carsley and his tweaks to England's playing style.
Asked about the changes, Stones said: ""Building up from the back, trying to get the lads to show their qualities on the ball and have that patience and belief that they show at their clubs and bring it all together as a collective.
""Everyone has seen a familiar face [Carsley] when we're at St George’s Park. 
""We've always been crossing paths and getting to work with him, for me personally and the lads feel the same, we're trying to make the most of it. 
""Lee and his staff have as well, and we've got two great results out of it.""

Injured Stevenson cancels October bout with Cordina,Author not found,2024-09-12T07:06:39.938Z,https://www.bbc.com/sport/boxing/articles/cr7r7vdvddko,"WBC lightweight champion Shakur Stevenson has pulled out of his fight against Wales' Joe Cordina on 12 October after having surgery on his hand.
The three-weight champion was scheduled to make the second defence of his lightweight belt after beating Artem Harutyunyan in July.
""Unfortunately my hand gave out on me but in 2025 let's bounce back and take over boxing,"" Stevenson wrote on X.
Stevenson and Cordina were set to meet in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on the undercard of the undisputed light-heavyweight world-title fight between Russians Artur Beterbiev and Dmitry Bivol.
The American has an unbeaten record in 22 fights, including 10 stoppages.
Stevenson, 27, signed a promotional deal with Eddie Hearn's Matchroom in August.
Hearn, who also promotes Cordina, described Stevenson as one of the ""pound-for-pound greats"".
Cordina was preparing to make an ambitious step up to lightweight after tasting defeat for the first time in his career.
The 32-year-old lost his undefeated record and IBF super-featherweight title against Northern Ireland's Anthony Cacace in May.
Cordina would have been one of three Britons challenging for a world title on the card next month.
Raven Chapman faces fellow undefeated fighter and defending WBC featherweight champion Skye Nicholson, while Jack Massey meets Australian IBF cruiserweight champion Jai Opetaia.
There is also a highly anticipated rematch between British rivals Fabio Wardley and Frazer Clarke.
Wardley, 29, will defend his British heavyweight title against Olympian Clarke, 33, after their thrilling first fight ended in a split-decision draw in March.
Meanwhile, Chris Eubank Jr, takes on Kamil Szeremeta in a middleweight bout and light-heavyweight prospect Ben Whittaker will attempt to extend his unbeaten record to nine at the expense of Liam Cameron.

Emma: Keira Walsh has a year remaining on her contract at Barcelona and has already informed the club she does not intend to extend because she is keen to return home for personal reasons.
That means Barca will either lose her on a free in 12 months' time or they could cash in on her this summer with several clubs interested.
Arsenal have a longstanding interest, while Chelsea are in the market for a midfielder and would have the funds.
The problem is that Barcelona do not want to sell. They are not prepared to name a price - though there's a general consensus that it would have to be a world-record fee should they consider any offer. We're at a bit of a stand-off, basically.
It was a Spanish bank holiday on Wednesday and Barca have a league game against Real Socieded at 19:00 BST on Friday evening, a few hours before the WSL transfer deadline - so the window for any business is small!
We will have to wait and see.
Jake: Do you think Aitana Bonmati’s future lies in the WSL or Spain?
Emma: We reported last week that Bonmati is close to signing a new contract with Barcelona, one which will likely make her the highest-paid female player in the world.
She has come through the club's academy and lives and breathes Barcelona. Both parties always wanted her to stay beyond her current deal, which expires next summer.
That's not to say she won't come to the WSL in the future. She has often challenged the Spanish league to continue developing and enjoys watching the competition in the WSL.
Si: If Villa sign Gabi Nunes is that their transfer business done or will they add any more?
Emma: We reported on Wednesday that Gabi Nunes' move to Aston Villa has been completed and we expect the club to confirm her signing in a record deal soon.
That's a big statement of intent from Villa and as it stands, they don't have anyone else lined up but they are keeping an eye on the market and having conversations so that could change.
They are also looking at potentially sending one or two of their young players out on loan. Those conversations are happening now.
Trevor: Are there any players likely to leave Chelsea before the deadline? Like their men’s team they have a big squad.
Emma: They want to strengthen their depth in midfield but they are also looking at a few loan options for some of their young players so there could be movement in and out.
Jamie: Crystal Palace have been busy in the transfer window ahead of their debut WSL season. How do you rate their chances of staying up?
Emma: They have and I believe they have managed to add a couple more in the final week of the transfer window so we're waiting to see who those players are.
I think they have recruited strongly but the jump up from the Women’s Championship to the WSL is huge and we've seen newly-promoted clubs struggle in recent years.
It will be difficult but I think Palace could have enough to finish above West Ham if they get off to a good start and can settle quickly.
Matt: Is there any movement expected for Everton? Their defence still looks very light.
Emma: We reported the club offered a short-term deal to goalkeeper Rylee Foster but the documents have still not been signed so we're waiting to see if that one goes through.
Other than that, I'm not aware of any other incomings. Everton are still exploring the market though.
Rachel: Any more potential Liverpool women incomings/ outgoings?
Emma: Not that I'm aware of. Liverpool always intended on making around three signings and they have done that. I don't envisage anyone else leaving on a permanent basis unless any wild late offers come in.
Becky: Do you think Manchester City are done for the summer or are they still in the market?
Emma: I believe that's their business done. They are happy with their squad. I don't expect any more signings between now and the deadline closing.
Phil: Is Ella Toone going to be tempted elsewhere (maybe not in this window). Big players continuing to leave United?
Emma: She signed a contract extension in November 2022 that keeps her at the club for another two years so that suggests she sees a long-term future at United.
She's also recently been named vice-captain. There will probably be interest when she comes towards the end of her deal next summer but we're a way off that yet.
Nic: Will Manchester United sign another goalkeeper?
Emma: That is their priority. They want three first-team goalkeepers and have two at the moment. They made Leicester City goalkeeper Lize Kop their main target but after several attempts, they eventually had to walk away. Leicester made it clear she was not for sale.
It means they have had to look elsewhere and so far, United have not made any progress.
Chiara: What are the chances of Spurs signing a midfielder to cover for Kit Graham’s ACL injury, and a first choice goalkeeper?
Emma: Tottenham are definitely looking for a midfielder to cover Graham's absence but they might not have enough time.
They were considering adding a new goalkeeper but having exercised the option to extend Becky Spencer's contract by another year and, having brought in Katelin Talbert on a short-term loan, they are prepared to wait until January and prioritise bringing in a midfielder.
Cyan: Do you think West Ham will be very busy before the window shuts as they have lost more players than they have signed and look a weaker team?
Emma: Yes! They will be working right up until the deadline closes. At the moment, they are looking to bring in hopefully two players. There's still work to be done but they know they are light and need to sign players.

What challenges will new USA boss Pochettino face?,James Nalton,2024-09-11T13:12:57.313Z,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cz6xqgey07qo,"For Mauricio Pochettino, the prospect of coaching the USA men's team in a home World Cup was an alluring one.
It offered a unique opportunity to make history and play a big role in the story of American soccer - but with that opportunity comes considerable challenges coupled with high expectations.
Pochettino becomes the first foreign coach of the USA men’s team since Jurgen Klinsmann left in 2016. This ambitious appointment of a figure of global renown echoes the women’s team’s recent hiring of English coach Emma Hayes. Both are coups for US Soccer sporting director Matt Crocker — the Welshman who previously worked with Pochettino at Southampton in 2013.
Pochettino's contract will run until the end of the World Cup in 2026 and, though there are Concacaf Nations League and Gold Cup tournaments to contend with between now and then, the focus will be squarely on preparing the team for that momentous World Cup on US soil.
Just hours after Pochettino’s appointment was announced, the USA, led by interim coach Mikey Varas, played a friendly with New Zealand in Cincinnati and only managed a 1-1 draw. This followed a 2-1 defeat earlier in this international break by neighbours and fellow 2026 World Cup hosts Canada, who are coached by the American former Leeds United manager Jesse Marsch.
Disappointing results like these against local rivals or teams they would be expected to beat reveal the scale of Pochettino’s task.
When it comes to the team itself, challenges present themselves throughout the squad as Pochettino will look to assemble a group that can compete on the world stage and win those regional Concacaf tournaments in the meantime.
Star attacker Christian Pulisic and proficient Fulham left-back Antonee Robinson are obvious starting points but the rest of the team is more uncertain, often due to match fitness and availability issues as much as talent.
For a new coach coming from outside American soccer, this could be seen as a positive - a blank canvas on which to draw up their plan and try to find the right balance between MLS (Major League Soccer) and Europe-based players.
It wasn’t too long ago there was talk of a golden generation of American players but, for various reasons, some of those much-hyped in their youth have so far failed to live up to their billing.
Only Pulisic has been able to do so and it is around this former Chelsea and current AC Milan attacker that Pochettino will be looking to build.
Pochettino’s appointment has been met with excitement in the USA and his lack of previous involvement in American soccer is mostly seen as a positive. With his tactical acumen, man management and standing in the game, he will be expected to get more out of the talent available than his predecessors managed.
The Argentine and his staff bring fresh eyes on the USA's player pool and he will be expected to shake things up, perhaps springing a few surprises with his squad selection.
Any fan frustrations are mostly around how long it has taken for an appointment like this to happen. There is a sense of urgency bordering on panic ahead of 2026 amid a realisation there are now not many games before the World Cup begins.
There is a feeling the team has too often been in limbo during this important cycle. It took US Soccer six months to decide to re-hire Gregg Berhalter after his contract expired at the end of the 2022 World Cup. Berhalter was sacked in July of this year after a poor showing at the 2024 Copa America and there has been a further wait of almost two months to appoint his successor.
The wait to re-hire Berhalter and the time taken to appoint Pochettino meant that more than half of the USA’s post-2022 World Cup fixtures have been overseen by an interim head coach. Far from ideal preparation for such a big moment in the history of the sport in the country.
On this occasion, US Soccer cannot be accused of leaving any stone unturned as they looked for Berhalter’s successor.
Just as they went for a coach considered among the best in the world for the women’s team in Hayes, they set similarly high targets for the men’s team.
Along with Pochettino, Jurgen Klopp was among the names Crocker and his team approached. They likely knew Klopp could not be tempted back into management after leaving Liverpool but the approach itself signalled their intent.
With Pochettino free after leaving Chelsea in May, he was always going to be one of the more realistic candidates of this calibre and US Soccer appears delighted to have secured one of its top targets.
Given the USA qualify for the World Cup as hosts, there will be relatively few competitive games for Pochettino to oversee between now and 2026.
His first games will be friendlies against Panama and Mexico next month. Panama’s rise to becoming the third-highest ranked team in Concacaf and Mexico’s recent drop out of the world top 15 make them unpredictable opponents.
Competitive action comes in the shape of the Concacaf Nations League Finals in November and March. As one of the top four teams in Concacaf, the USA get a bye to the two-legged quarter-finals, so there are a maximum of just four games to be played in that tournament.
Having won the three editions of the Nations League since it began in 2019, Pochettino will be expected to repeat that success, and will also be expected to win the Gold Cup (the Concacaf equivalent of the Euros) in 2025.
Pochettino’s appointment itself will increase expectations on this team but there is a sense that the USA have finally got the kind of head coach supporters have been calling out for.

How Palace can build on 'most successful' transfer window,Alex Howell,2024-09-12T07:07:50.178Z,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/ckg2r5prlpno,"Crystal Palace arguably had the most successful end to the transfer window of any Premier League club, and Saturday’s game against Leicester will be a chance for manager Oliver Glasner to unleash his new-look Eagles side.
His potential back three of Marc Guehi, Trevoh Chalobah and Maxence Lacroix may not even have been at the club given a different set of circumstances, as Palace did a flurry of late business.
At one point in the summer it seemed as if the Eagles were going to be raided for several of their top stars, with Newcastle bidding hard for Marc Guehi and interest in Eberechi Eze - on top of the sales of Michael Olise and Joachim Andersen.
Instead, they finished the window strongly with four players signed on deadline day alone, Guehi and Eze staying, more than £70m spent on squad improvements and almost £100m generated from sales over the summer.
But, with only one point from their first three games, Glasner now needs to bed in his new signings and get goals from £30m forward Eddie Nketiah.
Palace had planned for many different scenarios in the window and although they have created a reputation, with sporting director Dougie Freedman bringing in a number of talented youngsters from the Championship, they would say it’s not the only recruitment model they have.
It seemed only a matter of time before Guehi’s transfer to Newcastle was announced, on the back of his successful Euro 2024 with England.
Yet BBC Sport reported a figure of £70m was always going to be the key number that chairman Steve Parish regarded as “superstar money” to enable a deal to be done.
The Eagles were holding out for Newcastle to pay £65m upfront and £10m in add-ons for the 24-year-old – huge money for a centre-back going into the last two years of his contract.
Palace’s resolve was strengthened by new signing Chadi Riad’s injury, but especially so after Andersen’s £30m move to Fulham.
Andersen is believed to have made it known to the club that he wanted a new deal and improved terms on the contract he signed in 2021, when he joined the club.
The Eagles did not feel they could offer the 28-year-old the money or length of contract he was looking for and when Fulham got wind, Palace felt their offer was too good to turn down.
Guehi did not push for a move from the club and his conduct throughout the transfer window has been praised by manager Glasner and Steve Parish.
The departure of Andersen, Jordan Ayew, 33, and 31-year-old Sam Johnstone to Wolves for £10m meant Palace could put money back into the squad for younger players.
Riad is 21, new £18m centre back Maxence Lacroix is 24 and Nketiah is 25 years old.
Matheus Franca and Adam Wharton, both 20, were brought in last season and also helped bring down the average age of the squad.
Palace faced the near-impossible challenge of replacing Olise’s quality, which provided 10 goals and six assists from just 19 Premier League appearances last season.
The Eagles brought in three players with Nketiah, Ismaila Sarr and Daichi Kamada as options to play the number 10 role that Glasner likes in his team.
Nketiah has been brought in as a ready-made goalscorer at top-flight level and, although he will play the role differently to Olise, it’s hoped his goal threat and ability to run in behind will bring different qualities to the team.
One of the shocks of the transfer window was that star forward and England international Eze was not the subject of a formal bid from one of the division's elite.
Chairman Parish said he was ""astounded"" that no concrete bids were made.
The 26-year-old has a release clause of £60m, plus around £7m in add-ons, in his contract and that kicks in again next summer.
Palace would be willing to negotiate if the right offer was made for Eze, because of their relationship with the player and the ambitions he has to play at the top level.
Manchester City, Manchester United and Arsenal tentatively showed interest but, because of the way things moved in the market, no offer came through.
Glasner will be delighted to have kept the majority of his players together and is popular at the club.
Now the window is closed it is up to the Austrian manager and his revamped squad to see if they can replicate the success of last season, when they won six of their last seven games to finish in 10th place.

Ireland's Singh in recovery after liver transplant,Author not found,2024-09-12T10:14:47.523Z,https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/cje2evxdy70o,"Ireland all-rounder Simi Singh has said he is now in a ""recovery phase"" after liver transplant surgery.
The 37-year-old was reported to be facing ""life-threatening health circumstances"" after suffering from acute liver failure.
Cricket Ireland chief executive Warren Deutrom confirmed the situation earlier in September, saying it was ""shocking"" to learn that 37-year-old Singh was seriously ill, and sent him ""best wishes and prayers as he takes on this new fight"".
In a post on Instagram, Singh explained the liver failure was due to ""a case [of] wrong prescribed antibiotics and steroids,"" and added: ""I'm extremely fortunate to have my wife who eventually became the donor. I want to thank everyone for their message and prayers.""
The Times of India had reported that Singh was in the Medanta Hospital in Gurgaon awaiting a transplant and that his wife Agamdeep would donate part of her liver.
""The transplant is likely to be performed very soon, and the doctors are positive that the outcome will be in Simi's favour and will give him a new lease of life,"" the cricketer's father-in-law Parvinder Singh had told the Times of India.
Deutrom described Singh as ""a central figure within Irish cricket – whether at international, provincial or club level"".
""He has shown a desire and drive to succeed,"" Deutrom added.
""We now hope that this same drive will see him come through the current circumstances. Stay strong, Simi, we're all behind you.""
Singh has played 35 one-day internationals for Ireland and made 53 T20 appearances for the country, playing in the 2021 and 2022 T20 World Cup tournaments.

McIlroy 'hopeful' about PGA-PIF deal amid new talks,Matt Gault,2024-09-11T16:35:37.761Z,https://www.bbc.com/sport/golf/articles/cnvy49eq4eyo,"Rory McIlroy says he is ""hopeful"" that the fracture in men's professional golf will be resolved after news of the latest meeting between the PGA Tour and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF). 
Earlier this week, ESPN reported, external that a number of PGA Tour representatives, including Tiger Woods, were in New York for talks with the PIF, which funds the LIV Golf tour.
It has been 15 months since the PGA and DP World Tours announced a 'framework agreement' for a merger with PIF.
And while McIlroy, who recently voiced frustration at the lack of progress in the negotiations which began over a year ago, the world number three is hoping to hear good news from the New York meeting in the coming days. 
""I think everyone in the game would love there to be one [a resolution],"" McIlroy told BBC Sport NI. 
""A solution is hard to get to because there are different interests and people want different things. There's going to have to be compromise on both sides but hopefully they're the things they're talking about in those meetings.
""I'm hopeful and hopefully we'll be hear some good news in the foreseeable future where things start to come back together.""
McIlroy was speaking ahead of this week's Irish Open at Royal County Down, where he headlines the field in his first competitive appearance on home soil since the 2019 Open at Royal Portrush. 
McIlroy missed the cut that week, as he did when the Irish Open last visited Royal County Down in 2015, and admits he has struggled with the pressure of performing in front of his home fans in the past.
""I've had to learn over the years how to manage my week when I come home,"" the four-time major winner told BBC Sport NI. 
""I'm trying so hard to perform in front of the home fans but then if I push too hard it's detrimental to my game.""
McIlroy, whose sole Irish Open triumph came at the K Club in 2016, added: ""It's about managing all those emotions and getting lost in my own little world and not trying to do anything I wouldn't normally do. 
""Just go out there and play the best golf that I can and not get too frustrated when things don't go my way. If I can do that then I think I'll be OK.""
On what it would mean to win in Northern Ireland, he added: ""It would be extra special. 
""I think after the year I've had and the close calls, I've won three times and I've had to remind myself of that, but after everything that went on this summer and being so close to winning the US Open and being close at the Olympics as well, it would be a nice way to forget about those things and move on.""
McIlroy will play with fellow Northern Irishman Tom McKibbin during the first two rounds at Royal County Down, which the 35-year-old says is ""the number one links course in the world"". 
After finishing in a tie for ninth place at the Tour Championship earlier this month, McIlroy said he will aim to ""cut back"" his tournament schedule in the future after a congested 2024 which will see him compete in 27 events by the end of the year.
But while he is targeting a 22-tournament calendar in the future, he says he will ""definitely"" be back at the K Club for the Irish Open in 2025.
""For Shane [Lowry] and myself and some of the other guys that play predominantly in America, this date suits better,"" he said.
""We can focus on the FedEx Cup and Stateside and then turn our attention to Europe.
""These two weeks, here and Wentworth [for the BMW PGA Championship] next week, we're always looking forward to getting back. It's a long stretch in the States so to get back and play two great tournaments, a lot of guys enjoy that so I'll definitely be back.""

Harris produces 'one of best' Davis Cup debuts to clinch GB win,Jonathan Jurejko,2024-09-11T14:07:59.250Z,https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/articles/c3d9gy81l42o,"Billy Harris produced ""one of the best Davis Cup debuts you'll have seen"" to ensure Great Britain's quest to reach the knockout stage started strongly - even without the rested Jack Draper.
Late bloomer Harris, who used to drive to low-level tournaments in a van before earning his first ATP Tour win last year, clinched an opening victory against Finland in the group stage.
The 29-year-old looked unflappable in a 6-4 7-6 (7-4) win over Otto Virtanen which gave the hosts an unbeatable 2-0 lead.
US Open semi-finalist Draper celebrated from the sidelines, having sat out the tie following his exploits in New York.
Harris' win came after Dan Evans, 34, won 7-6 (7-3) 6-2 against 703rd-ranked Eero Vasa to put Britain ahead in Manchester.
""I'm absolutely thrilled for Billy – I think that's one of the best debuts you'll have seen. It was that good,"" said British captain Leon Smith.
""If you look at Otto's record over the past couple of years in the Davis Cup it's pretty flawless.
""Billy actually could have won in a more straightforward manner – he was absolutely immense. Nothing really kind of fazes him, even though he's not really been on a big court before.""
Harris' display meant Smith's decision to give Draper, 22, more time to recover paid off, but he could return for the round-robin contests against Argentina and Canada later this week.
Britain are aiming to finish in Group D's top two and reach the Davis Cup Finals last eight in Malaga this November.
Evans and Neal Skupski could not complete a clean sweep as they fell to a 7-6 (7-4) 7-5 doubles defeat against Virtanen and Harri Heliovaara.
Britain could be left to rue not winning the tie 3-0, with the competition's format meaning every match counts until the end.
""It feels disappointing because it is a long day and last year [at the same event] it almost came back to bite us, not getting that 3-0 on the first day,"" added Smith.
""But it is a positive day. At the start, when you don't have Jack and Cameron Norrie – your two highest ranked players - and end up winning a tie 2-1, you'd take that.""
As the post-Andy Murray era begins, the British squad has a fresh look and new impetus.
Former world top-10 player Norrie is missing through injury and Harris - joined as a rookie in Smith's squad by Wimbledon doubles champion Henry Patten - has been rewarded for his stunning rise over the past 18 months.
The journey to the cusp of the world's top 100 has been long and arduous.
Driving around Europe to play in lower-tier events, sleeping in his van while parked in McDonald's car parks, stood as testament to Harris' dedication.
He was a hitting partner when Britain played in the Davis Cup Finals knockout stage in November - now he is playing a pivotal role in their quest.
Asked where the victory ranked in his career, Harris said: ""I think making my debut for Great Britain and winning on my first cap probably tops it all so far.
""Three years ago I was probably ranked about 600 so I had no chance of getting near the team.
""But I've been improving each year since then and feel like I was ready to step into the team once I got called up.""
Evans, despite a difficult season where he has struggled for form and fitness, is a reassuring presence in this British team.
He has dropped to outside the world's 150 in recent months but, in front of about 6,500 fans at Manchester Arena, demonstrated his value.
Those watching would have been forgiven for thinking Evans would breeze past the unheralded Vasa, a regular on the bottom-rung Futures Tour.
However, the 27-year-old Vasa surprised the crowd - if not Evans - by playing well above his ranking.
""It was a difficult match,"" he said. ""He played great at the start. I knew he would come out and play aggressive.
""I found it tough for a long time to get the ball-striking and I started to play better in the second and better at the end.""
Having missed out on last year's Davis Cup Finals knockout stage, Spain got past the Czech Republic in Valencia in their quest to avoid the same fate in 2024.
There was a brief scare for Carlos Alcaraz, who dropped the opening set of his match against Tomas Machac before recovering to level at 6-7 (3-7) 6-1. Machac, seemingly cramping, then retired in the opening game of set three. Spain's Roberto Bautista Agut had earlier defeated Jiri Lehecka 7-6 (7-1) 6-4.
Italy beat Brazil in Bologna behind singles wins for Matteo Berrettini and Matteo Arnaldi.
The United States fended off Chile 3-0 in Zhuhai, China, with third-set tie-break wins for Reilly Opelka, Brandon Nakashima and the doubles pairing of Austin Krajicek and Rajeev Ram.
Canada also beat Argentina 2-1 in Manchester, Belgium overcame Netherlands in Bologna by the same score, Australia defeated France 2-1 in Valencia, and Germany sunk Slovakia 3-0 in Zhuhai.

Skinner says short-term contracts an issue in WSL,Emma Sanders,2024-09-12T08:08:16.152Z,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cr5ngjm272lo,"West Ham manager Rehanne Skinner says short-term contracts in the Women's Super League is an ""issue"" that needs addressing.
The club have lost seven players on permanent transfers this summer, all of whom were regular members of the first-team squad. 
Among them were Australia goalkeeper Mackenzie Arnold, Japan internationals Risa Shimizu and Honoka Hayashi and former vice-captain Hawa Cissoko - all were on two-year deals which expired. 
It meant the club did not receive transfer fees and lost some of their best players, having to work hard on recruitment this summer to replace them. 
""It's a conversation I had with the club - something we needed to iron out and put in place. Short-term contracts have been an issue for sustainability,"" said Skinner.
""We know the turnover has been quite high in the club previously. I'm trying to support the management of that and even that out a lot better - for the fans and the sustainability of the team.
""[It's about] having a better structure around contract lengths and for when people are coming out of their contracts too.""
Skinner says there's a collective need to be ""good in a business sense"" to get the most out of talent developed at West Ham. 
""There's good, quality players that have gone through the club,"" she added. 
""We want to make sure that everything the club has invested in them, we can get a return on [financially] as well as what the players are offering us while at the club.
""We need to look at both sides of that and it's something that has to be factored in moving forward.""
This summer, West Ham have signed five players on three-year deals and Skinner says she hopes the club can create ""stability"" for fans going forward. 
""Last season we were doing a lot of work on trying to put foundations in place. We appreciate they have seen a lot of change,"" she said.
""We want to create that stability this year so they really have something to root for. I think we showed our identity last year and what we’re trying to achieve.""

'Call me!' - the bosses who could revive your team,Michael Beardmore,2024-09-11T08:01:17.987Z,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/ce380jklj44o,"The new football season is already a month old.
And while the garden might be rosy for Manchester City, Liverpool, Brighton, Arsenal and a few others, some Premier League clubs have had far more underwhelming starts.
Fans - and maybe chairmen - will already be casting glances at the market of available managers and coaches.
At present, this talent pool appears to be impressively deep.
BBC Sport takes a look at some of the out-of-work big names awaiting their next big assignment.
The 51-year-old German spent little more than 18 months in the Premier League - but while his tenure at Chelsea was short, it was trophy-laden.
He won the Champions League, Uefa Super Cup and Fifa Club World Cup in his first few months, and the Blues reached both FA Cup and EFL Cup finals in the next season too.
Disagreements with the club's new owners nevertheless meant Chelsea dispensed with his services.
A subsequent spell with Bayern Munich did not go to plan, but Tuchel remains the man to have taken Paris St-Germain closest to Champions League glory - they reached the 2020 final under his guidance - and his resume is hugely impressive.
After eight years as England manager, taking the Three Lions to two European Championship finals, Southgate is on the market again.
The 54-year-old's only experience in club management was a three-year stint at Middlesbrough from 2006 to 2009 but - after his achievements with England - surely it will not be long before he returns to the game.
Manchester United were heavily linked with a move for Southgate in the summer, until they backed current boss Erik ten Hag.
Tuchel's predecessor at Stamford Bridge, Blues legend Lampard earned credit for the job he did during a difficult 18 months for the club between 2019-21.
Hamstrung by a transfer embargo, the ex-England midfielder still guided Chelsea to a top-four finish, an FA Cup final, helped youngsters like Reece James flourish and arguably set the platform for Tuchel's success.
Having previously taken Derby to the Championship play-off final, his stock was high after his Blues exit but, after a year fighting fires at Everton and a forgettable interim Chelsea return, Lampard has been out of management since May 2023.
When he was sacked by Chelsea - yes, them again - in April 2023, few would have expected Graham Potter to be out of a job for long. But almost 18 months later, here we are.
Potter's short stay at Stamford Bridge did not work out amid a huge squad overhaul, but he previously received widespread acclaim for his work at Brighton, having initially honed his managerial skills with Swedish club Ostersund and Swansea.
The 49-year-old turned Brighton into a respected Premier League force in three years on the south coast and remains heavily touted for any high-profile job that becomes vacant - including the England post.
David Moyes has never managed Chelsea! However, he had a fruitful spell in London until recently.
The 61-year-old Scot is a free agent after four and a half years at West Ham, where he not only provided regular European football against the odds but guided the Hammers to a Europa League semi-final and the Europa Conference League title.
Given the success he achieved at Preston and Everton earlier in his managerial career, Moyes will surely have suitors at some point in the near future.
It is to his enormous credit that he has come back strongly from his ill-fated season as Sir Alex Ferguson's hand-picked successor at Manchester United.
One La Liga title in two and a half years was not enough for Barcelona to offer club legend Xavi an extended stay in the Nou Camp dugout.
The 44-year-old did, however, keep the Catalan giants dining at most of football's top tables during a lengthy period of financial uncertainty and upheaval.
The prospect of him following one-time mentor Pep Guardiola to the Premier League is surely a salivating one for footballing purists.
Speaking of midfield maestros, the mercurial Zinedine Zidane has been out of management since leaving Barcelona's Clasico rivals Real Madrid in 2021.
The Frenchman is untested as a coach outside the Spanish capital but his record there, with admittedly vast resources at his disposal, was jaw-dropping.
He led Madrid to three successive Champions League titles - a first for any coach - in his first spell, and won a La Liga title in his second tilt at the job. But could any club carrying a torch for the 52-year-old tempt him back - bar his beloved Real?
The ex-Liverpool boss has said he wants at least a year away from the game - and that he would never manage another Premier League club apart from the Reds.
Many a well-intentioned promise has been broken in football, of course, but perhaps Klopp's comeback really will come outside England.
The 57-year-old - who won virtually every major trophy club football has to offer during his nine years at Anfield - will surely have Europe's heavyweights forming a queue when he does decide the time is right to return.
Alan Curbishley is still waiting for the call. Many managers who looked destined for great things in the Premier League have slipped back into near anonymity, such is the harsh nature of the game.
As well as bosses with Premier League experience, the continent is awash with available talent.
Multiple Serie A winner Max Allegri awaits a new challenge after a decade, across two spells, at Juventus, while ex-Roma and Lyon boss Rudi Garcia was ditched by Napoli last year.
Joachim Low has spent three years waiting for the phone to ring after a 15-year spell as Germany boss that brought Die Mannschaft the most recent of their World Cup triumphs.
Niko Kovac, a Bundesliga title-winning boss with Bayern Munich, left Wolfsburg in the spring, while Edin Terzic ended his Borussia Dortmund reign in June after a run to the Champions League final.
Stefano Pioli, the 58-year-old who has managed AC Milan and Inter Milan among a string of top Italian teams, remains on the market, as does long-time Porto boss Sergio Conceicao, who ended his seven-year reign this summer.
And one more Stamford Bridge alumnus deserves a mention - veteran Maurizio Sarri, whose eccentricities made for good fun at Chelsea in 2018-19 and who left Lazio after three years in March.

Arsenal's Odegaard set for at least three weeks out,Author not found,2024-09-11T11:41:38.354Z,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c74l2r97l78o,"Arsenal captain Martin Odegaard is set to be out for at least three weeks with an ankle injury, according to Norway's team doctor.
Ola Sand said there is ""probably no fracture"" to Odegaard's left ankle, which he injured while playing for Norway on Monday, but added that an absence of less than three weeks would be ""just a bonus"".
Odegaard limped off during Norway's Nations League win over Austria and on Tuesday the 25-year-old midfielder returned to London, where he underwent an MRI scan.
Arsenal have said that manager Mikel Arteta will provide an update during his news conference on Friday, before Sunday's north London derby at Tottenham.
But Norway's team doctor Sand told Norwegian newspaper VG:, external ""Such ankle injuries often take at least three weeks. Anything other than that is just a bonus and then it can take longer.
""What we have so far obtained from the MRI examination in London is that there is probably no fracture in the ankle.
""Arsenal are almost certain there is no breach, but this may still take some time. In the event of a fracture, we are talking about being out of action for six weeks plus.""
If Odegaard is out for three weeks he would miss five games for Arsenal, including next Thursday's Champions League game away to Atalanta and their Premier League game at title rivals Manchester City on 22 September.
The Gunners will also be without two other midfielders for Sunday's north London derby as Declan Rice is suspended while summer signing Mikel Merino is sidelined with a fractured shoulder.
Fellow summer signing Riccardo Calafiori is doubtful after the Italy defender was forced off during Friday's Nations League match against France with a calf problem, but striker Gabriel Jesus could soon be back in contention following a groin problem.

"Watson 'strongly denies' assault claims, says attorney",Author not found,2024-09-11T19:11:12.305Z,https://www.bbc.com/sport/american-football/articles/cpvy9ev9vjgo,"Cleveland Browns quarterback Deshaun Watson ""strongly denies"" the latest sexual assault allegations made against him, his attorney said on Wednesday.
An unidentified woman is seeking $1m (£764,000) in damages after filing a civil lawsuit against the 28-year-old in Houston, Texas on Monday.
The incident allegedly occurred while the pair were on a date in October 2020.
Browns coach Kevin Stefanski, meanwhile, says Watson will face the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday after playing in last weekend's season-opening defeat against the Dallas Cowboys.
Stefanski said he was unaware of the allegations before the lawsuit was filed and had not considered leaving Watson out. 
""Deshaun strongly denies the allegations,"" said Watson's attorney Rusty Hardin in a statement on Wednesday, adding they were ""comfortable he will ultimately be vindicated"".
""In the meantime, Deshaun is going to focus his energy and concentration on football.""
The NFL said on Tuesday it would be reviewing the allegations against Watson, who was suspended for 11 games without pay and fined $5m (£3.83m) in August 2022 following an investigation into multiple sexual misconduct allegations.
Watson denied the claims, and two grand juries ruled there was not enough evidence to charge him. He later reached confidential settlements with 23 of the 24 women in the summer of 2022.
Watson has only made 13 starts for the Browns since he joined from the Houston Texans on a five-year deal worth a then-NFL-record $230m (£174.4m) in March 2022.

I protected De Ligt by taking him off - Koeman,Author not found,2024-09-11T10:11:38.287Z,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cg4y6gp6kkxo,"Netherlands boss Ronald Koeman said he substituted Manchester United centre-back Matthijs de Ligt during their 2-2 draw with Germany on Tuesday night to ""protect"" him.
De Ligt, 25, was replaced at half-time in the Uefa Nations League clash in Amsterdam by Brighton's Jan Paul van Hecke after the defender had a hand in both of Germany's first-half goals.
A misplaced pass in the first half led to Deniz Undav equalising before his failed clearance led to Joshua Kimmich giving Germany the lead, just three days after De Ligt made mistakes in the Dutch's 5-2 win over Bosnia and Herzegovina.
“Of course I would rather have kept [Matthijs de Ligt] on the pitch,"" Koeman told Dutch broadcaster NOS.
“It just looks like he is now in a period where all his mistakes are being punished.
""I gave him a new chance today but eventually I protected him by taking him off."" 
Koeman spoke publicly on De Ligt's performance in their win on Saturday, where he was unable to mark 38-year-old striker Edin Dzeko as he scored Bosnia's second goal in Amsterdam.
""We have discussed it,"" Koeman said in his press conference on Monday before the draw against Germany.
""He did not get his footwork right. It was a bad individual moment for a defender. You have to learn from that, it is clear that these kinds of moments need to be improved. 
""But we should not be dramatic about it and put too much emphasis on it.""
De Ligt, who has 45 international caps, only joined United last month from Bayern Munich in a deal worth over £42m (including add-ons).
Competing with De Ligt in Koeman's squad for minutes are fellow Premier League defenders Virgil van Dijk, Nathan Ake, Micky van der Ven, Jurrien Timber, Van Hecke and Sven Botman, who is currently injured.
During the 2-2 draw, Manchester City's Ake was stretchered off in the first half with what appeared to be a hamstring injury.

Republic of Ireland lack 'world-class'  player - Browne,Author not found,2024-09-11T22:00:13.185Z,https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cy0nerpzj5jo,"Republic of Ireland midfielder Alan Browne believes his side are missing a ""world-class"" player to help them end their poor run of form.
Tuesday's 2-0 defeat against Greece in the Uefa Nations League was their fourth competitive home loss in a row. 
They have only won three of their last 15 matches - two those of those coming over minnows Gibraltar. 
""We probably don't have that presence, that Premier League quality player that stands out a mile from the rest like you might have had in years gone by,"" said Sunderland's Browne.
""Boys are playing in the Premier League and doing quite well, but we don't have that world-class figure that everyone looks at and thinks he is going to win us the game.
""I know Evan [Ferguson] has obviously got a bright future, but it is a lot to put on his shoulders, being so young and he hasn't played a lot of football.""
Browne, who has won 37 caps for his country, disputed the notion the Republic of Ireland do not have leaders in the group, instead pointing to their lack of quality in the final third as a greater factor in their losing streak.
""I think there are quite a lot of leaders in there,"" said the 29-year-old.
""There are quite a lot of players who have captained their club or captained their country, so you are probably just missing that presence rather than leadership.""

West Ham sign Finland midfielder Siren,Author not found,2024-09-12T09:00:34.052Z,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/ckgwg1wjdvno,"West Ham have signed Finland international Oona Siren from LSK Kvinner on a two-year deal.
The midfielder made 19 top-flight appearances for the Norwegian club, providing four assists. 
The 23-year-old becomes manager Rehanne Skinner’s eighth signing of the summer.
Siren has also played for Finnish top flight and in the Women’s Champions League qualifying rounds.
""I’m looking forward to the challenge of playing in England. I know the Women’s Super League is the best league in the world,"" said Siren. 
""I want to test myself against the best players and the best teams. My experience of playing for Finland and in the Champions League has given me the motivation to keep pushing to be the best player that I can be. 
""I know that coming to West Ham and working in this environment will help my development as a player. I can’t wait to get started.""

Honda and Alpine breach F1 cost-cap rules,Andrew Benson,2024-09-11T09:34:05.430Z,https://www.bbc.com/sport/formula1/articles/cn47e8l2897o,"Engine manufacturers Honda and Alpine have both committed a ""procedural breach"" of the Formula 1 cost-cap regulations, says governing body the FIA.
Honda is the partner of world champions Red Bull while Alpine is the supplier for the Renault-owned team of the same name.
A statement from the FIA did not detail the specifics of the breaches, which took place in the 2023 season, but said neither had exceeded the spending limit.
A procedural breach typically would revolve around discrepancies in the filing of financial information.
The FIA said that both Honda and Alpine had ""acted at all times in good faith"" and were ""co-operating"" with the FIA’s cost-cap administration team ""to finalise the matter"".
The FIA said it was proposing that both enter into a so-called 'accepted breach agreement' meaning the competitor agrees they have broken the rules and accepts some form of sanction.
A Honda spokesperson said: ""We would like to discuss the details of the matter after the ABA is disclosed by the FIA. 
""In any case, it was a simple procedural mistake and not at all intentional. Furthermore, even including this procedural error, we have not exceeded the cost cap.""
An Alpine spokesperson said: ""The breach in question is directly in relation to Alpine Racing SAS (Viry-Chatillon) and relates to an administrative issue, and is in no way associated to financial overspending.
""We acknowledge and accept the findings of the review process and remain in regular dialogue with the FIA to ensure future compliance.""
Honda has been contacted for comment.
The statement added that all 10 teams had been found in compliance with the cost cap on their chassis-manufacturing side.
Last year was the first season in which the cost cap applied to engine manufacturers as well as teams.
In 2022, the FIA found that Red Bull had overspent by more than £1.8m in the first year of the cost cap the previous season. The team were fined $7m (£5.35m) and given a 10% reduction in their permitted aerodynamic research time.
In the same year, Aston Martin were found to have committed a procedural breach and were fined $450,000 (£344,000).

'Europe must keep Solheim momentum rolling',Peter Scrivener,2024-09-11T11:13:41.463Z,https://www.bbc.com/sport/golf/articles/c80e8gjyrz1o,"Underdogs. Hostility. Momentum. Unfinished business.
The buzzwords that accompany team golf were once again brought to the fore as the Robert Trent Jones Golf Club in Virginia opened its doors to the 19th edition of the Solheim Cup.
Europe, despite looking to retain the trophy for a record fourth time, are undeniably the underdogs – captain Suzann Pettersen admitted as much – but arrive with the momentum from last year's thrilling 14-14 tie at Finca Cortesin in Spain.
The USA, desperate for a first win since 2017, will have a boisterous backing, with a reported 100,000 fans set to descend on the tree-lined course, which is an hour west of Washington DC.
""It's nice to get this going again,"" Pettersen told BBC Sport.
""It feels like we just left Spain and we need to keep the momentum rolling.
""Playing away is a tough task to get this done for the fourth time but the players are up for it.""
Also fresh in the Pettersen’s mind - and that of 10 of her players, given there are only two rookies in Europe's team - is the 4-0 defeat they suffered on the opening morning at Finca.
Pettersen's positive spin a year on is that those Friday foursomes were ""a wake-up call"". Vice-captain Laura Davies told BBC Sport last December that in the immediacy of that day Petterson ""asserted her captaincy and laid into the players"".
So will the Norwegian, a veteran of nine Solheim Cups as a player, continue her assertive captaincy style this year?
""I learned my lesson,"" she said of her softer approach at the start of that first week in Spain.
""Just being authentic - being me - is what they expect. The passion and energy I always had for this is what I want to pass on to the players - why I really fell in love with this.
""What we learned the most is being precise. Giving clear messages goes a long way.
""I'm going to be quite direct with the players and, whatever match or pairings we decide, the players are all up for it.
""They are looking for a strong leader, so I’ll do my best.""
That leadership strength will be tested to the full this week in an environment that Pettersen expects will be ""the real playing"" of an away match after the ""odd experience"" of winning at Toledo in 2019.
""We had literally zero European support because of Covid,” said Pettersen of Europe’s second away victory. ""It was hostile. This will be very different from that. It’s going to be loud, with chants between the fans. It’s going to have a lot of energy and be a great event for women’s golf.""
Half of this European dozen played in the most recent defeat, in Iowa seven years ago, with English duo Charley Hull and Georgia Hall, Spain’s Carlota Ciganda and Anna Nordqvist of Sweden going on to form a core spine of the unbeaten run since.
For the US, only the retiring Lexi Thompson and the returning Alison Lee have been on a winning side.
Thompson, who made her debut in 2013, was part of the victorious 2015 and 2017 teams, while Lee has not played since her first event nine years ago.
It has led to a ""theme of unfinished business"" in the American camp this year, according to Megan Khang, who went unbeaten 12 months ago and said the team are ""hungry"" to regain the trophy.
This desperation to end the drought has also upped the Solheim stakes a notch among the fans, but Pettersen says her players are well equipped to deal with any taunts from outside the ropes.
""It’s a strength of the team that they are all playing in the US on regular basis, so are used to it,"" she said.
""But that comfortableness gets tested on Friday morning.""

'Carsley has put his stamp on England - job feels like his to lose',Phil McNulty,2024-09-10T22:33:14.012Z,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c15gewlnvj3o,"England’s interim manager Lee Carsley was grateful to the golden boots and golden goals of captain Harry Kane to strengthen his case to become Gareth Southgate’s permanent successor.
Kane deservedly took centre stage on the night of his 100th cap, almost inevitably scoring twice in a ruthless display of finishing to give England victory over stubborn Finland in the Uefa Nations League and make it two wins from two for Carsley.
For the low-key Carsley, in his trademark England tracksuit and admitting he still feels uncomfortable with his new lofty status, Kane’s contribution was as precious as the striker’s footwear as his unblemished start in charge continues.
Carsley has never got carried away in his career and in this case context must be applied, even though six points from six is the return he would have craved when he was handed the reins for the early days of the post-Southgate era.
He has been presented with opposition ranging from desperately poor against the Republic Of Ireland to game but very limited in the shape of Finland, England taking 57 minutes to finally turn an overwhelming weight of possession into Kane’s thumping first strike, to which he added another 14 minutes before the end.
Carsley’s cause - and we must assume he wants to be the next England manager even though he publicly refuses to even hint at such a desire - would have been damaged had he not won both games but he will delighted, and a touch relieved, to have escaped any traps.
It is tough to make any defining judgement based on these two victories but Carsley has increased the sense that the England job is his to lose. He could not have done any more.
Carsley has graduated via England’s Under-21s, as did Southgate, winning the European Championship in 2023 while offering a guiding hand to so many of the youngsters he brought into his first squad.
He is part of the so-called ""England DNA"" coming out of St. George’s Park and the manner in which Spain coach Luis de la Fuente, who inflicted misery on Southgate’s side in the Euro 2024 Final in Berlin, took the same path in his country may also play into the FA's thinking.
If possession, as the old saying goes, is nine-tenths of the law then Carsley now has it in his gift over coming months to make the FA's decision for them.
England's two performances under the 50-year-old have been a mixed bag. 
The first half against the Republic was excellent and brought two goals before a stodgy second half. The win against Finland was the reverse, Kane showing his class and a reminder of his enduring importance after his struggle to make any impact at the Euros.
Carsley has put his stamp on England, from the new young faces such as Angel Gomes, who had a fine debut at Wembley, to giving Trent Alexander-Arnold the backing and the platform to finally deliver for his country what he regularly produces for Liverpool.
Alexander-Arnold did not appear to have Southgate's full trust, especially in the defensive aspect of the game, while the ""experiment"" of using him in midfield in Germany in the summer was ill-thought-out and doomed to failure.
Carsley has talked up what Alexander-Arnold can do rather than what he cannot and has been rewarded in both games, starting with an outstanding pass that showed remarkable vision to Declan Rice's first goal in Dublin.
He helped to set up Kane's first goal against Finland with another piece of intelligence, creating the most chances for England  on the night with five. It is the third time he has created five or more chances for his country since 2019, with no other player doing so on more than one occasion in that time.
Carsley was full of praise, saying: ""You have seen Trent's array of passing, an ability to control a game. It's not a surprise as we have seen him do it for Liverpool.""
As with England, greater tests will lie ahead for Alexander-Arnold, especially defensively but Carsley's words will be music to the ears of the 25-year-old, who has sometimes looked a little unloved on international duty, a fact reflected in the statistic that this was only his 31st cap stretching over a period of more than six years since his debut.
The big bonus for Carsley is that his selection decisions have also enabled him to highlight the scale of options open to him, with Newcastle United's Anthony Gordon showing the pace and creation to add to options on the left flank while Jack Grealish has made his impact in the number 10 role. 
This had all happened with the hugely-gifted trio Jude Bellingham, Cole Palmer and Phil Foden out with injury and illness.
England's interim manager was brutally honest about feeling his way into his new role, saying: ""I definitely don't feel comfortable still.
""I have been out of my comfort zone. It's been enjoyable but we have had to make sure every single day we are producing high standards. We are fortunate to have got two good results so it is about building on that.""
He told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""As you can imagine it is a test. Not only for myself, but for the rest of the staff. We have shown to ourselves that we can do it and we can implement what we are trying to do. We can put ideas in place and the players have responded really well to what we have asked.""
The straight bat was still being pushed firmly forward at Wembley when he was asked whether this meant he was saying he wanted the job: ""I will definitely not be saying that. I am totally relaxed about the situation. I have got to do a good job.""
Carsley's next assignment is at home to Greece at Wembley in October followed by a trip to Helsinki to face Finland - two more wins and his bandwagon might just start to gather unstoppable momentum.

'Fireworks expected as US seek Solheim success',Iain Carter,2024-09-11T01:12:17.676Z,https://www.bbc.com/sport/golf/articles/c7v52nq4y8do,"Stand by for another weekend of extreme golfing drama because the Solheim Cup has established itself as the sport's most dependable source of thrilling and feisty matchplay.
With the United States desperate to end an unprecedented run of European success, up to 100,000 fans are expected to pack the Robert Trent Jones course in Virginia for the matches which begin on Friday.
This is an area rich with American civil war history and it is surely set to bear witness to stirring sporting hostilities in the coming days.
Of those, a couple of thousand will be cheering Suzann Pettersen’s European team. The rest will be belting out chants of “U-S-A, U-S-A”, to urge the home team to lift the precious trophy for the first time since 2017.
Pettersen and opposite number Stacy Lewis share great mutual respect, especially after last year’s thrilling draw at Finca Cortesin in Spain - the first in the contest's 34-year history. 
But they are also uncompromising competitors and the Solheim is no stranger to controversial moments.
To add to the potential spice, this is the first time in nine years since two principal figures in one of the match’s most infamous moments last lined up against each other.
Alison Lee has returned to the US team. She was the player who erroneously picked up her ball in the 2015 match in Germany, thinking a short putt had been conceded by the European pairing of Charley Hull and Pettersen.
The Norwegian, now leading Europe, had other ideas and contentiously claimed that 17th hole and it helped Europe take a 10-6 lead into the closing singles matches.
The Americans were outraged, and the incident proved the inspiration for a stunning fightback and an extraordinary victory for the visitors by the narrowest margin.
Back then Lee was badly shaken by her rookie error and resulting furore, while Pettersen agreed it was not her finest moment. Nearly a decade on, the US golfer is a more mature and composed figure.
She was assured and pointed when asked about the incident this week. “I would say in the moment it was tough,” Lee said. “I was very intimidated at the time.”
But referring to Pettersen, the 29-year-old Californian gave no ground. She said: “I'm not going to lie, I haven't really talked to her at all since then.”
Europe’s skipper has no reason to reopen old wounds. Quite rightly she says “the past is the past and we are way beyond that” and points out that both teams have changed substantially since then.
However history suggests there is plenty of potential for the blue touch paper to be ignited once again.
In 2021 there was a row when Madelene Sagstrom picked up Nelly Korda’s ball as it hung on the edge of the hole. Too quickly, it was deemed.
The Swede was left in rueful tears after the match was lost by a single hole, with Korda being awarded an eagle because her ball might have fallen below ground on that 13th hole.
Sagstrom and Korda, who describes this contest as “unfinished business”, will be on duty on opposite sides once again this week, as will Carlota Ciganda.
The Spaniard, who was an emotional hero on home soil a year ago, benefitted from a contentious drop in Colorado in the 2013 match. This followed an argument that lasted around half an hour over where it should occur.
No one compromised on that occasion and nor did they elsewhere in that contest when it was claimed Europe should have been penalised.  This was because a caddie, under instruction from vice-captain Annika Sorenstam, tried to tactically concede an American putt.
And Sorenstam was involved in perhaps the Solheim’s most contentious moment back in 2000. The Swedish legend holed a crucial chip while playing with Janice Moodie at Loch Lomond’s 13th hole.
The US pair of Kelly Roberts and Pat Hurst claimed that, even though their opponent was off the green, she had played out of turn because their ball was further away on the putting surface.
American captain Pat Bradley (auntie of new US Ryder Cup skipper Keegan Bradley) ordered Sorenstam to play again, nullifying the chip in. Europe called it an “unsporting decision”.
Passions always run high in Solheim Cups. ""I never really do big gestures and stuff when I make a putt,” Swede Maja Stark, who is playing for the second time, explained.
“All of a sudden at Solheim, I just started screaming and fist pumps and everything. I had no idea that was going to come out.
“So I know that that might happen this week.”
These Europeans are up for the fight - just as they were in Toledo three years ago when they had no travelling support because of Covid travel restrictions.
Defending the trophy in Ohio that week was the continent’s finest hour. It would be a similar scale of achievement were they to do it again here in Virginia.
There is significant mutual respect between the teams; they share the same LPGA tour week in, week out.
But this is no ordinary week. It stirs emotions like no other and there are fierce competitors on both sides.
This means we are likely to witness another compelling contest and a sprinkle of controversy would come as no surprise.

'Night belongs to him and his golden boots' - Kane's 100 caps in numbers,Author not found,2024-09-09T18:30:49.857Z,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c36n934x5l6o,"Captain Harry Kane became the first player to score two goals on his 100th appearance for England as he fired the Three Lions to victory over Finland in the Nations League at Wembley.
The striker scored his 67th and 68th international goals in the second half, thundering an excellent strike in off the underside of the bar, then curling in a neat finish.
He becomes just the third player to score on his 100th England appearance, after Wayne Rooney (versus Slovenia in 2014) and Bobby Charlton (against Northern Ireland in 1970).
""I don't think I was even thinking of 100 caps when I was on loan at Millwall, Norwich and Leicester,"" Kane said.
""From being a young age, from being doubted to go on and do what I have done - I just think that helps keep you focused and motivated in training and games. 
""In general and nowadays as a footballer you're going to get criticism, you're going to have people talk about you as a player. I’ve always spoken about when things aren't going your way using that to motivate you and bring an energy and hunger inside you to go and perform.
""Come October I will be ready to go again.""
Before kick-off, Kane was presented with a golden cap to mark the achievement, and also wore golden boots during the match.
""The night belongs to him and his golden boots, so fitting for Kane,"" former England defender Matthew Upson said on BBC Radio 5 Live.
""It's a match which will not live long in the memory other than that reason. Two super-sharp finishes, the first one was hit with venom and power, then the second one was a real centre-forward finish - that is the moment of the game.
""The rest of the game we can pull it apart, but it belongs to Harry Kane.""
But while it became a night to remember for Kane, a few days ago he was not even sure he would be there.
""There was a late change to mark Harry Kane’s 100th appearance for his country,"" BBC Radio 5 Live commentator Ian Dennis said.  
""When I spoke with the England captain at the team hotel on Friday in Dublin he told me they were looking to celebrate his landmark occasion in October. The reason was because he wasn’t sure at the time he would start the game against Finland.
""As a result it meant 'a lot of this has been last minute' according to Kane. His family were still in Munich on Monday but travelled on the day of the game - his wife Kate and three of their four children.
""However, the occasion was too much for Louie, only three, who was in tears in the tunnel leaving daughters Ivy and Vivienne to act as mascots alongside their dad.""
The Bayern Munich striker is the first person since Wayne Rooney in November 2014 to earn a 100th cap for England.
Rooney went on to earn 120 caps, putting him second on the all-time appearance list behind former goalkeeper Peter Shilton (125).
The others to have surpassed the century of appearances are David Beckham (115), Steven Gerrard (114), Bobby Moore (108), Ashley Cole (107), Bobby Charlton (106), Frank Lampard (106) and Billy Wright (105).
""When you look at the list [of players with 100 caps] it is a list of some our greatest players,"" Kane said.
""I'm sure when I'm retired I'll look back on this with immense pride.""
Kane said he will next target reaching 100 goals after making his 100th England appearance.
""I've done around 15, 16, 17 caps a year whereas a normal year would be 10,"" he added.
""The goals were similar. I felt I was on 30 goals and then I went to 50 and then 60.
""It is definitely there and definitely possible. I feel like I am in a good place and these are good targets to try to reach.
""Some people may see them as unrealistic but I would rather go for something unrealistic and not quite make it rather than be comfortable just saying I will be happy with 70 or 80 goals.""
It all started for Kane with a goal just 79 seconds into his debut. 
Starting on the bench in a Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania in March 2015, a 21-year-old Kane came on with the Three Lions 3-0 up and headed in his first goal for his country.
Since then he has scored 48 more goals than any other England player. He has also provided more assists than any other player in that time with 17.
Of his 100 caps, 29 have come at major tournaments for England (11 at the World Cup, 18 at the Euros), more than any other player.
As well as being England's record scorer, he also has the most goals for England at major tournaments, with 15.
Kane has scored five hat-tricks for England - against Panama, Bulgaria, Montenegro, Albania and San Marino. Only Jimmy Greaves has scored more with six.
His 100 caps have come under four different managers. He made his debut with Roy Hodgson as boss and played 16 times for him, scoring five goals. 
Kane played in Sam Allardyce’s only game in 2016 before making 81 appearances and scoring 61 goals under Gareth Southgate. 
He then started on Saturday in Lee Carsley’s first game in charge against the Republic of Ireland.
Asked about what has been the most difficult thing to be able to keep playing at the highest level, Kane told BBC Radio 5 live: ""I think to be able to keep producing great numbers, keep producing great moments is probably the hardest thing to do, because there are many players who are trying to take your spot and to take your place.
""It is healthy to have that but to be able to get my 100th cap in nine years, essentially shows great consistency.""
Last week, Portugal great Cristiano Ronaldo reached the landmark of 900 career goals for club and country at the age of 39.
Kane is eight years younger than Ronaldo and the Bayern Munich striker says he sees the former Manchester United and Real Madrid forward as inspiration for how long his own career can go.
""I feel in really good shape, both physically and mentally, at a peak in my career,"" he said.
""Watching other players, Ronaldo scoring his 901st goal [against Scotland on Sunday], seeing him compete at 39 years old inspires me to play for as long as possible.
""I love this game, I love representing England more than anything and I don't want it to end any time soon. For me, personally, now it's about continuing to improve and being consistent both in an England shirt and at club level.
""I'm hungry for more. I'm determined to keep pushing the boundaries.""

Will 'genius' Newey turn Aston Martin into winners?,Andrew Benson,2024-09-10T13:31:26.596Z,https://www.bbc.com/sport/formula1/articles/cy76rk5gndxo,"Adrian Newey is the Formula 1 design genius with the Midas touch.
The 65-year-old sprinkles his stardust on an F1 team and it tends to make the difference between good and great.
That is exactly what Aston Martin owner Lawrence Stroll hopes he has bought with what is said to be a £30m package that has tempted Newey to join a team struggling in fifth place in the World Championship.
Will Newey be the decisive factor that turns Aston Martin into winners? Stroll certainly believes so, and the vibe at the team’s factory on Tuesday when Newey was announced suggests he is not the only one.
Stroll described the money he is paying Newey as ""a bargain"", and said he has ""never been more certain"" about a decision he made during 30 years in business.
""It is relatively inexpensive for everything Adrian brings,"" the Canadian billionaire said.
Stroll has already invested hundreds of millions in a state-of-the-art new factory and wind tunnel at the team’s base across the road from Silverstone Circuit, and an engineering team packed with big names.
Newey is both the icing on the cake and potentially the single most important ingredient of that investment.
That new factory was part of what attracted Newey to Aston Martin, the man regarded as the greatest F1 designer in history said on Tuesday at the news conference to announce his new job.
Newey described the facility as ""just stunning - it is not an easy thing to do to build a brand new factory on a brand new site and have a really nice warm, creative feel to it. Because that is what we’re here for - to be creative, to come up with good solutions and have good communication.
""I’ve seen some new buildings that haven’t quite fulfilled that. I am so looking forward to starting.""
Another part of Newey's decision was the fact that, with Stroll as owner and a constant presence, Aston Martin feels to him as if it is ""back to the old model"" of an F1 team.
""If you go back 20 years,"" Newey said, ""then what we now call team principal were the owners, and in this modern era Lawrence is unique in being the only properly active team owner. It is a different feeling when you have someone like Lawrence involved like that.""
The money is a bonus, of course, but with Newey it has never been about the money. ""I still love the challenge of trying to add performance to the car,"" he said. ""That is my prime motivation and what gets me up in the morning.""
Newey's reputation goes before him - 13 drivers' championships and 12 constructors' titles for three different teams over a 30-year period tell a powerful story.
Whether joining Williams in 1990, McLaren in 1997 or Red Bull in 2005, Newey’s presence has been the catalyst for a period of dominance. Two, in the case of Red Bull.
The evidence of the power of Newey’s influence can already been seen by virtue of its absence at Red Bull this year.
Newey was last plugged into the F1 team in Miami back in May. Since then, as he counts down the days to what he calls his ""new challenge"", Newey has been working on selling his RB17 hypercar, and Red Bull have started to struggle.
They look likely to lose the constructors' championship to McLaren. And Max Verstappen has even started to express concern about losing the drivers' title, despite his current 62-point lead.
That cannot all be down to Newey’s absence, of course. But some of Red Bull’s apparent lack of understanding of how to fix their car’s problems surely will be, for Newey combines a genius for aerodynamics with unrivalled experience, great expertise and insight as a race engineer, and what Damon Hill describes as a ""unique gift"" for understanding what drivers need from their cars.
Newey will, he says, be full-time at Aston Martin when he starts work in early March. At Red Bull he has also spent time on other projects in recent years.
Before and since Newey left, there have been attempts to play down his involvement in Red Bull’s success over the past few years.
It was well known that among Newey's reasons for leaving Red Bull was his annoyance that some in the team were trying to claim credit where he believed it was due to him.
And when he was asked on Tuesday why he had decided to go full-time at Aston Martin when he had chosen to be on something like three days a week at Red Bull, he said: ""I don’t know where three days a week came from."" Except of course he does.
He emphasised that as soon as Honda joined as engine partner in 2018 ""I got properly involved on the F1 side [again]"", and only ""felt able to sit back a little once we got through the design of the 2022 car because the 2023 and this year’s car were very much evolutions of that first car"".
Newey has his work cut out at Aston Martin. As he pointed out, the new aerodynamics rules for 2026 will be released at the beginning of January, and he does not start work until March.
""It will be a case of getting myself up to speed as quickly as possible, and just as importantly getting to know everyone here as quickly as possible, and how we get the best out of each other,"" he said.
""They [the new rules] are an opportunity. Whether we will be able to capitalise on that, we just don’t know. I don’t spend too long fretting on these things. Just get on and do the best we can.""
How will he perform his role as managing technical partner? He joins forces again with technical director Dan Fallows, who was head of aerodynamics at Red Bull under Newey before joining Aston Martin in early 2022.
Newey, Fallows said on Tuesday, ""goes where he thinks he can add value"". He draws the fundamentals of the car layout on his fabled drawing board, analyses reports, sits in some meetings, and contributes and asks questions and guides where he feels it is needed.
Newey is a brilliant man, but he is not an egotist. He is happy to embrace any engineering idea, whatever its provenance, as long as it makes the car faster.
And just his mere presence will energise belief in the team.
Fernando Alonso, whose contract lasts until the end of 2026, has waited more than 20 years to finally get a chance to work with Newey, and has been deprived of at least two world titles by the Englishman’s genius.
Newey jokingly called Alonso an ""arch-rival"" over many years. Alonso said: ""I would say Adrian was more an inspiration thanks to his talent and cars. We all got better as a driver, as engineers; we all had to raise the bar thanks to him, to be able to compete.""
If history is anything to go by, that bar may be about to be raised again.
